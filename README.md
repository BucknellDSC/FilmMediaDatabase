Abstract:
---------
The Film Search Engine started as a database of lines of dialogue from films with a corresponding screenshot. Each screenshot was taken from the film during the time the line of dialogue was being spoken. This relational database allows users to search for text and be returned images, which is invaluable in film and media research. However, an idea is only as good as its ability to be reached by its users. The database needed a website which would not only allow users to conduct their research, but allow them to do so quickly and intuitively. 

Our project aimed to make a well designed web interface to aid in the research being conducted by our users. By employing good design practices, we were able to narrow down exactly what users need to be successful and make them want to return to our website in the future. We selected React.js for building our website and followed Googleâ€™s Material-UI style guide, both of which are decisions that will make it easier for people to continue development in the future. Our work resulted in an intuitive application, granting users the ability to easily conduct their research and view their results in a well formated environment.
