1
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:07,012
I want you
to suck my big dick.

2
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,379
Woman:
Marty honey, dinner.

3
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,249
I want you
to lick my balls.

4
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,652
Girl: His cock?

5
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,223
His cock was beautiful.

6
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:03,202
And he ate me out
for an hour.

7
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:06,134
Lisa, you know,

8
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:08,970
it's all about attitude.
If you want it, you can get it.

9
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,374
You just got to get
your fuckin' ass on the beach.

10
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:14,937
- Work for it.
- Lisa: Whatever.

11
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:35,359
Excuse me,
sandwich boy?

12
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,232
Aren't you supposed
to wear gloves,

13
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:40,740
'cause I don't know
where those hands have been.

14
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:49,211
Fuckin' pigs, man!

15
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:54,019
- My name's Marty, what's yours?
- Just give me the sub, asshole.

16
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:57,147
Ask the bitches to meet us,
fuckhole! We'll party.

17
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,921
We're going surfing,
at 3:00.

18
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:03,121
If you want to meet us
at North Beach.

19
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,424
Maybe we'll think about it.

20
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,868
Great, babe,
you can be my date.

21
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:12,268
My friend here
will take that one.

22
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:13,772
Hey, fuck you, man.

23
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:31,449
- Those guys were fine.
- He was making fun of me.

24
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:34,756
No shit. He was just being
an asshole. Guys are like that.

25
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:36,762
But the other one,
the shorter one...

26
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,559
- The cute one.
- Yeah, Marty.

27
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:40,600
He acted like
he wanted to meet you.

28
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:43,864
- Meet you, you mean.
- No, his buddy's got dibs on me.

29
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:45,564
His buddy's the boss.

30
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,266
I've never been
around such a hunk.

31
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,272
Oh!

32
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:03,413
- Cute butt.
- Yeah.

33
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:07,550
He's sweet.
The other one's an asshole.

34
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:22,907
Boy: You wanna go
to a party?

35
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,167
Sure.

36
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:33,852
- You're a pretty hot surfer.
- Thanks.

37
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,444
You could go pro.

38
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,317
What planet
are you living on?

39
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:40,552
Earth, fucker!

40
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:43,653
Compared to you,
he's fuckin' Kobe Bryant.

41
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:02,408
- Marty: What do you guys want?
- Go get a bottle of tequila.

42
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:05,076
Can you give me some money?
I only got six bucks.

43
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
What was that, boy?

44
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:09,187
Was it "Yes sir, boss. I'll buy
that booze for you now?"

45
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,948
What I thought, bitch!

46
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:20,459
You're an asshole.

47
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:24,035
Baby,
you know what I like.

48
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:28,535
Boy: Come on up here. I'm starting
to dig you a little bit.

49
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:38,379
Damn, baby.

50
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,018
(rap music playing)

51
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,496
- Welcome to the party, bitch!
- Girl: Fuck!

52
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,636
Marty:
Take your pants off.

53
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,041
Come on, baby.

54
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,976
Marty:
You're fuckin' beautiful.

55
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:18,056
Marty: Back up.

56
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:23,287
(Lisa breathing heavily)

57
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:24,421
Yeah.

58
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:42,611
(moaning)

59
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,095
Woman:
Good morning.

60
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:43,940
- I got a new boyfriend, Ma.
- A new what?

61
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,179
- A new boyfriend.
- A boyfriend?

62
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:50,443
Mother: What kind?

63
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:52,550
A hunk.

64
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:54,618
Really?

65
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:58,280
Yeah,
you're gonna meet him.

66
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:00,451
(techno music playing)

67
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:22,345
I hear your cute friend
gives good phone.

68
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:26,511
Marty's the best.
He'll make you come in two minutes.

69
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,488
- Can I call him?
- No, he'll call you.

70
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:40,098
He lives with
his parents, you know.

71
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:45,700
Okay look,
right now...

72
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:48,866
$100 if he gets
on stage and dances.

73
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,069
I hope you know
you're getting up there.

74
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:54,636
No way, man.
No way.

75
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:57,239
Come on. A hundred bucks
is a hundred bucks.

76
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,217
I can make the money
somewhere else.

77
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:02,652
Get the fuck up there
right now, it's $100.

78
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:03,916
Go!

79
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:05,923
Get up there.

80
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:17,800
Make 'em proud.

81
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,736
(techno music playing)

82
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:35,981
Boy:
160, 180, 200...

83
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,108
Plus what you got,
that's 300.

84
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,848
What's the matter, man?

85
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,758
You enjoyed that,
back there, didn't you?

86
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:48,919
Hell no. I ain't queer
like those guys.

87
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:49,893
Bullshit.

88
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,329
Bullshit,
I think you like dick.

89
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:55,162
Ain't got to lie to me, boy.
I know you like dick.

90
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:56,360
Fuck you!

91
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:57,460
- (car honking)
- Look out!

92
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:58,799
- (tires screeching)
- Man!

93
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:01,704
You fuck, you fucked up
my fuckin' car!

94
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:02,741
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck!

95
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,644
Watch the fuck out!
You're gonna make me wreck!

96
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:09,307
- You stupid fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

97
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:12,408
- You piece of shit!
- Motherfucker!

98
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:18,415
- Fuck this goddamn shit!
- (tires screeching)

99
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:20,985
Marty?

100
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:23,790
Hey, get in the car.

101
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:28,861
Fuck you, man.

102
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,129
(gasping)

103
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:43,077
I'm sorry, man.
Let's just go.

104
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:46,114
Let's go, I'm sorry.

105
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,244
Get your fuckin' hands
off me, Bobby.

106
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:50,947
I'm really sorry.

107
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,058
You're my best friend.

108
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:56,620
Okay?

109
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:23,519
Coming inside
or what, Lisa?

110
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,523
No, I'm waiting
for my new boyfriend.

111
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:27,582
You met Marty,
haven't you, Claudia?

112
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,957
No, I don't think so.

113
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,588
- Is he cute?
- He a hunk.

114
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,435
(ranting)

115
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:27,818
- Aaah!
- What the fuck?!

116
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:28,911
I'm next!

117
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:33,481
Mother: Lover bug?

118
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,620
Oh, my God.

119
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:46,532
Can we move?

120
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:52,138
Man: Haven't we already
discussed this?

121
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:53,940
Can I have a car, then?

122
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:58,883
Why can't we just move out
of this dumb neighborhood?

123
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,079
Man: Marty,

124
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:06,614
we can'tjust quit ourjobs and leave
because our son's having problems.

125
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:07,886
Fine.

126
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:10,887
Fuck it!

127
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,505
(doorbell ringing)

128
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:54,998
Maybe we could hang.
My cousin gave me some weed.

129
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,268
That's cool.

130
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:03,907
(moaning)

131
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:34,877
Marty: First time
I ever smoked weed,

132
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,082
it was in
the eighth grade,

133
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,983
and I knew a lot of kids
who had been doing it...

134
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,613
but I was always afraid to,

135
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:45,782
'cause I was raised
strict Catholic.

136
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:49,191
I was taught that the worst
thing you could do in life,

137
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:51,127
would be to make
your mother cry.

138
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:55,632
She always told me if she caught me
messing with dope it would kill her.

139
00:15:57,003 --> 00:16:00,530
But Bobby... he was
always bugging me about it.

140
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:03,131
It was so fucking
important to him.

141
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:05,734
If he did it,
I had to do it.

142
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:07,176
So one day...

143
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:11,307
we were at the bus stop,
waiting for the bus,

144
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:13,375
and I smoked some
with Bobby.

145
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:18,615
And he told me
the shit was, like, weak.

146
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:20,591
That I'd barely
even feel it.

147
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:25,954
He must have fuckin' dusted
that shit or something, 'cause...

148
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:29,900
the whole fuckin' world
warped around me, man.

149
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:32,597
I had no idea
how to handle it.

150
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:35,402
The only thing
I could think to do was run.

151
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:41,538
I take off, Bobby's running
behind me, laughing like crazy.

152
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:45,015
I get home and I get in my bed and
I pull the covers over my head...

153
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:51,053
Like bury myself under a pillow.
I was so fuckin' scared.

154
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,190
Bobby yanks
the covers off of me.

155
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:00,965
- You know what I did?
- No.

156
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,330
You know what I did?

157
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:06,200
What baby?

158
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:10,871
I fuckin' pissed
all over myself.

159
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,317
Lisa:
I love you, Marty.

160
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:27,555
I love you so much I can't even
believe how much I love you.

161
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,862
I would do
anything for you.

162
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:44,160
Claudia:
Hi Lisa. What's up?

163
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,543
Girl: Oh, man!

164
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,272
- Whose is it?
- It's Marty's.

165
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:57,907
Shit. Couldn't it be Bobby's?
Haven't you fucked them both?

166
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:00,611
No, it's Marty's.

167
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:04,820
She says that
like she actually knows.

168
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,392
Boy: Watch what he does.
Holy shit!

169
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,024
Watch, he's not done.
Eat his heart, Derek.

170
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,659
Hey, asshole, I don't know
how to eat his heart, nobody does.

171
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:38,681
Boy: I know who your girlfriend is,
your right hand.

172
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:41,692
- Derek, I need a ride.
- Can't you see I'm busy?

173
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,591
I need a ride
over to Marty's.

174
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:48,926
Okay, let's go, cuz.

175
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,764
(boys arguing)

176
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,041
I need to talk to you.

177
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:00,806
- Later. I'm busy.
- Now!

178
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:05,476
What?

179
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:14,351
- Hey dude. What's happening?
- Nothing.

180
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:17,452
Come on in, let me show you
what me and Marty are working on.

181
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,792
It's definitely cool.

182
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,332
Come here, man.

183
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:25,596
Take a look at this.

184
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:28,730
We picked up this
guy from the Copa.

185
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:32,937
Got him to do
all this fucked up shit.

186
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:34,912
I can't believe
you got a guy to do this.

187
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,880
Yeah, it's fuckin'
disgusting.

188
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:39,650
It's nasty, Dude.

189
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:41,447
- You and Marty did this?
- Yeah.

190
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,512
We're gonna sell this to porno shops.
They'll pay top dollar for this.

191
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,990
This is gross, dude.
I'm gonna wait outside.

192
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,151
You don't like
our fuckin' tape?

193
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:52,857
No, it's gross shit, man.
I don't like it at all.

194
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,797
I don't.
I'm gonna wait outside.

195
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:57,165
Okay.

196
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:05,406
I'm not ready to be
no dad, Lisa.

197
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:07,274
Let go of me,
please!

198
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:09,814
You'll the money
and get it fixed.

199
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:13,784
You fucking hear me,
God damn it?

200
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:16,844
- Huh? Answer me.
- Let go of her, asshole!

201
00:21:16,922 --> 00:21:20,187
- We were just messing around.
- You're just messing around!

202
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:22,454
Does this look like
messing around, asshole?!

203
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:23,460
I'm sorry.

204
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:26,362
Jesus Christ, you call
this messing around? Look!

205
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:28,263
- I said I was fuckin' sorry!
- Fuck you!

206
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,632
- Motherfucker!
- Fuck you! Get out of here.

207
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:32,000
- Bring it, motherfucker!
- Fuck!

208
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:34,869
- Motherfucker, bring it!
- Bobby: The fuck is with you?

209
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:38,336
(door slamming shut)

210
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:42,779
She's fuckin'
pregnant, man.

211
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:47,312
She's fuckin' pregnant!

212
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:50,644
It's fuckin...

213
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:54,382
Lisa's mother:
Little motherfucker!

214
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:57,190
I'm sending my goddamn
brother over there.

215
00:21:57,262 --> 00:21:58,752
He's gonna beat
the shit out of him.

216
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:00,662
- I mean beat the living shit...
- No Mama, please.

217
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,531
I love Marty.
I love him more than anything.

218
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,631
I don't understand this.

219
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:13,801
I don't understand
what is going on with you.

220
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,281
Maybe
I don't wanna know.

221
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:21,046
Please, Ma,
don't get Marty hurt.

222
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,417
Fine.

223
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:28,821
You need a bath,
young lady.

224
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:32,227
Clean yourself up!

225
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:13,929
It's Bobby.

226
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:21,742
(panting)

227
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,994
(phone ringing)

228
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:38,395
Oh, fuck!

229
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:41,865
I paged my dealer.
It's gonna be all right.

230
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:46,927
Hello?

231
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,236
Where you've been, bitch?
I've been calling you forever.

232
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:54,245
I've been hangin' out with
this guy Donny who's totally hot.

233
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:57,679
You're still fucking
that surfer?

234
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:01,542
Girl: I heard you're
fuckin' pregnant.

235
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,021
Yeah...
we're totally happy.

236
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,457
Guess what? His friend Bobby
is so hot for you,

237
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:12,156
he wants you to come down
and experiment and shit.

238
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:15,962
He's into some spooky shit
even you wouldn't believe.

239
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:17,001
Really?

240
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:21,205
I'll see.

241
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:44,384
Girl: Is Bobby nice?
I mean, can he be?

242
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:46,658
I don't know,
you met him.

243
00:24:46,732 --> 00:24:49,098
He was an asshole
when I met him.

244
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,697
Bobby and I have been friends
since we were almost born, and shit.

245
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,807
Then he must be nice.

246
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:03,171
Yeah, I guess.

247
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,187
Man: I haven't seen
your friend, lately.

248
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:13,424
I said, I haven't seen
Marty lately.

249
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:17,688
Man: That's good.

250
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,654
He's probably too busy
with his surfing.

251
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:22,700
A game that children
play at the beach.

252
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:27,263
It's a way of life.

253
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,034
Really?

254
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:30,631
Did your friend Marty
tell you that?

255
00:25:32,244 --> 00:25:33,211
What kind of life is...

256
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:37,612
splashing around in the waves
and saying "Wheee!"?

257
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,647
May I be excused?

258
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:48,222
No.
Son, you are smart,

259
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:50,193
you have ambition,
you have presence.

260
00:25:50,262 --> 00:25:54,699
Your friend Marty is living
a life of complete aimlessness.

261
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:57,826
I don't know what happened to him.
He used to be a good kid.

262
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:00,167
He's got no ambition,
no fire in his gut, nothing.

263
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,934
I don't want you spending
so much time with him.

264
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:06,677
I will move this family
far away from here

265
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,372
before I see you
waste your life away.

266
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:10,677
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

267
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:15,580
I booked a piano lesson
for you Thursday.

268
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:18,520
That fit
into your schedule?

269
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:21,357
Bobby: It's good.

270
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:26,126
Nowadays everybody wanna talk
like they got something to say

271
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:27,665
But nothing comes out
when they moves their lips

272
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:30,998
And motherfuckers act...
like they forget about Marty

273
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,627
...somebody you hate.

274
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:33,796
(rap music continuing)

275
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:34,964
Marty singing: What...

276
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:40,811
Girl: You remind me
of my ex-husband.

277
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:43,003
You're married?

278
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:45,982
Was married,
like three months.

279
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:47,712
You got any kids?

280
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:49,947
A little boy,
but it's no big deal.

281
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:51,284
My parents
take care of him.

282
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:53,483
Okay.
That's cool.

283
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:58,458
I'm going to college soon.

284
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:01,158
- Really?
- Yeah.

285
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:03,758
I got like four credits
before I graduate.

286
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:05,928
I've got like
a B average.

287
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,471
No shit.

288
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:09,302
(rap music continuing)

289
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:11,239
Motherfuck the Police.

290
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,642
That always
pisses me off, man...

291
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:15,805
They always take
the motherfucking good words

292
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:17,610
off the fuckin'
videos, man.

293
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:20,174
What are you gonna do
after college?

294
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,219
I don't know. Me and my dad might
go into this business together.

295
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,021
Like one of those window tint
sound system places.

296
00:27:29,094 --> 00:27:30,391
Oh yeah,
those are cool.

297
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:32,896
So you'd have
your own one?

298
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:35,763
Yeah, he could
set me up in one.

299
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:39,867
He's always
on me about it.

300
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:41,303
That's cool.

301
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:44,433
I mean, like he wants
to help and shit.

302
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,342
Yeah.
My dad's pretty cool.

303
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:41,327
- Watch this.
- Oh, that shit is gross.

304
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:46,096
- You know that turns you on.
- No, it's just gross!

305
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,696
You can tell your daddy.
Watch it. Watch it!

306
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:51,072
- No it doesn't, it's gross.
- Come on, just watch it.

307
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:52,576
Girl: Get off me.

308
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:55,704
Watch it.
Fuckin' watch it!

309
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:58,113
No. No.

310
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,852
- Wanna get fucked?
- Fuck you.

311
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:11,862
- You want to get fucked?
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

312
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,591
- Say I'm the best you ever had.
- Fuck you!

313
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:15,929
- Say I'm the best you ever had!
- Fuck you!

314
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:17,195
Fuckin' say it!

315
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:21,429
Girl: Fuck you!

316
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:23,098
- Fuckin' say it!
- Fuck you!

317
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:25,302
- Say it!
- (girl crying)

318
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,875
Fucking like that!

319
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:34,477
Say it! Say it.

320
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:37,420
Say I'm the best.
Say it...

321
00:29:37,489 --> 00:29:38,820
Girl crying: You're
the best I ever had.

322
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,154
- Say it!
- You're the best I ever had.

323
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:44,218
- Say it louder!
- (crying)

324
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:46,594
- Say it louder!
- Best I ever had.

325
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:57,973
So, how was it?
I told you he's a stud.

326
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,477
Yeah, more
like a goddamn queer.

327
00:30:00,545 --> 00:30:02,809
The fucker
just raped me.

328
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:05,644
Shit, Ali, make up
your fuckin' mind.

329
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,150
I told you he was kinky.

330
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,425
- Hi, Mr. Kent.
- Where's my son?

331
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,105
God damn it, he probably
showed her that queer shit.

332
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:43,784
I told you not to hang out
with him and I meant it.

333
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,184
- I'm thinking about selling the house.
- No, please, Dad.

334
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,558
I won't hang out
with Marty anymore.

335
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:54,030
- I promise.
- Can't you see he's dragging you down?

336
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,896
Dad, yes I do.

337
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,202
I promise I won't
hang out with him.

338
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:02,172
- Just give me one more chance...
- He didn't even finish high school.

339
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,141
I know, he's a loser.
I know that, I see that.

340
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:08,679
They came over to say hello.
That's it, I swear.

341
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:12,680
Dad.

342
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:17,378
Hey Bob, you know...

343
00:31:18,557 --> 00:31:21,253
I saw a stereo place
for sale on the way home.

344
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:23,260
It was like the one
we talked about,

345
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:25,853
only it didn't have
the window tinting.

346
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:27,728
Bobby, you can do it.

347
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,393
You can do it, Bob.
I know you can.

348
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:32,800
I can help you.
I'll get you all set up.

349
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:37,203
Bobby, it's the best future
you can have in this country.

350
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:38,936
To be your own master.

351
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:48,285
If I do this for you,
can we hire Marty?

352
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:59,086
Wow, you're really good.

353
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:02,326
- Where are you from?
- Michigan.

354
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:05,528
I used to be better
when I was competing.

355
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:07,299
Why did you stop?

356
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:10,606
I don't know.

357
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:16,206
- You be good, little man, all right?
- All right. See you.

358
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,556
What do you want to do?

359
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:32,222
I wanna ask you
something, Marty.

360
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:35,823
Why do you let Bobby
treat you the way he does?

361
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,197
What?

362
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:40,171
Why do you let Bobby
treat you like he does?

363
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:42,365
Hit you and stuff
and make fun of you?

364
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:46,100
He disses you right to your face
in front of everyone.

365
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:50,971
Derek thinks you guys
are queer for each other.

366
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:53,176
Derek's an asshole.

367
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:54,275
You know what?

368
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:59,683
- I love you.
- Shut up.

369
00:33:00,892 --> 00:33:03,019
I do. I love you and
I care about you,

370
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:04,561
and I don't want
to see you suffer.

371
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:08,491
I don't wanna see Bobby
picking on you ever again.

372
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:15,239
Bobby...

373
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:17,570
Lisa: What?

374
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:23,841
He's been like this since
we were little fuckin' kids.

375
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,044
He's always been like this.
(sobbing)

376
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:33,613
He's always beat the fuck
out of me, whenever he wanted.

377
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,820
There's not a goddamn thing
I can do about it.

378
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:40,563
I begged my fuckin'
parents to move...

379
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:42,429
Lisa: You could
move away yourself.

380
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:46,265
I'm not even
a high school graduate.

381
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:50,597
Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

382
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:55,546
So there is nothing
we can do to stop him ever.

383
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,843
We could kill him.
That's about it.

384
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:02,512
That's what
I was thinking.

385
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:04,588
What?

386
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:07,848
What are you
talking about?

387
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:11,719
- Lisa: Bobby.
- What about Bobby?

388
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,389
What if he was gone?

389
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:19,034
What kind of weird shit
are you talking about?

390
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:23,703
What if we killed him?

391
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:26,073
Are you fuckin' nuts?

392
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:32,443
He treats everyone
like shit.

393
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:35,452
He's always mean,
he's always cruel.

394
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:38,021
Beats you up.

395
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:42,855
He's even too weird for Ali
and she's into everything!

396
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:46,887
He's the source of
everybody's troubles.

397
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:50,491
And even still,
he's gonna finish high school

398
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:52,866
and go to college
and probably get rich.

399
00:34:52,937 --> 00:34:55,906
Yeah, and I'm gonna be delivering
pizzas to him in Weston.

400
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,403
Marty:
How would we get a gun?

401
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:03,140
Lisa:
My ma has one.

402
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:11,916
Shit,
that motherfucker...

403
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:14,886
has fuckin' dissed me...

404
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:18,190
and treated me like shit
my whole goddamn life.

405
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,129
Let's kill him.

406
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:33,467
Marty: No shit!

407
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:46,648
- Ali: You are one crazy bitch.
- Lisa: No I'm not.

408
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:48,919
No I'm not.
Marty agrees with me.

409
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:51,655
This is the way for everyone
to take care of their problems,

410
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:54,357
because Bobby is everybody's
fuckin' problem.

411
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:55,990
What do you want me to do?

412
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:59,036
- Come down and help us.
- Oh, man...

413
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:02,731
Ali: Wow. What are you
gonna do it with?

414
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:05,742
I don't know.
A gun or a knife, I guess.

415
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:17,152
Donny: Bitch.

416
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:18,382
Good.

417
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:23,018
- Ali: What are you doing?
- Just talking to my dog.

418
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:25,562
- Are you high?
- Not enough.

419
00:36:27,332 --> 00:36:29,732
My mom's in here
and she's like...

420
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:32,895
she's like making plans
for my 18th birthday party.

421
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:36,338
She's gonna have a cake,
a clown and all that shit.

422
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:38,500
You know, like
when you were a kid.

423
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:41,170
I think
she's happy here.

424
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:43,271
I think she likes it
a lot better than New Jersey.

425
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:45,714
Lisa: I need
to talk to you about something.

426
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:47,250
I've got to go
to Fort Lauderdale

427
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:49,946
to help my friend Lisa
kill this asshole named Bobby.

428
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:52,012
I like it
when you pull my hair.

429
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,421
Donny: Cool.

430
00:36:54,492 --> 00:36:56,392
Donny: Shut up.
You won't kill this guy.

431
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:57,894
Ali: Yeah.

432
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:00,157
- Donny: No.
- Yeah.

433
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:02,563
- No.
- Yeah.

434
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:04,795
Donny: Kill him?
Like kill him in real life?

435
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:06,803
- Donny: Kill him?
- Ali: Yes.

436
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:09,431
- Like kill him, he's dead?
- Yes.

437
00:37:10,642 --> 00:37:13,270
- No.
- Yes.

438
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:17,174
Whoa, Ali.
That's some heavy shit.

439
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:19,682
- You want to go with me?
- (Donny chuckling)

440
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:21,548
I got some
really good dope in.

441
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:24,281
- (cell phone ringing)
- Well okay, sure.

442
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:25,754
I'll go with you.

443
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:26,915
- Hello?
- Girl: Hey!

444
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:28,686
Where the fuck
are you, bitch?

445
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:31,419
Girl:
Back in rehab.

446
00:37:31,496 --> 00:37:33,794
I'm kind
of messed up, Ali.

447
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:35,025
Girl: Tweak.

448
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:38,994
Ali: Listen, I gotta go down
to Fort Lauderdale,

449
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,504
to help my friend Lisa kill
this asshole named Bobby.

450
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:44,064
But if you want,
I can come pick you up.

451
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:48,678
Okay.

452
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:54,885
What if we drive by his house,
when he's in his yard or some shit?

453
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,921
Shoot him down.

454
00:37:56,988 --> 00:37:59,456
Cops will think
it's a gang thing.

455
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:03,986
Shit, Lisa.
That a fuckin' great idea.

456
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,984
Donny:
Ow! Fuck, man!

457
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:35,316
Girl:
Thanks for getting me, Ali.

458
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:37,418
I stick
with my homies.

459
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:39,656
Is thatjoint
all you're holding?

460
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:42,924
We've got a glove box
full of acid.

461
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:47,634
Any tweak?

462
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:50,196
How was rehab?

463
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:06,146
Lisa: Just about raped Ali
last time she came.

464
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:10,625
He beats me.
He's raped me.

465
00:39:10,695 --> 00:39:13,095
The worst part is the way
he picks on Marty.

466
00:39:13,164 --> 00:39:16,725
He treats him like a dog
or a slave or something.

467
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:18,496
Pisses me off so bad
I can't stand it.

468
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:20,537
So, what are you
gonna do, Lisa?

469
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:22,505
I'm gonna kill him.

470
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:25,804
- That's some heavy shit.
- Yeah, it is!

471
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:28,539
Donny:
How are you gonna do it?

472
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,104
Why are you guys
so serious?

473
00:39:31,182 --> 00:39:33,650
We're gonna fix
Bobby Kent's ass.

474
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:34,980
Claudia: Cool!

475
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:38,420
Holy shit!

476
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:40,821
Donny: Can we get
some napkins?

477
00:39:40,892 --> 00:39:42,951
- Claudia: I'll be back.
- Donny: And a straw.

478
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:46,260
How are we gonna do it?

479
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,958
Lisa: I was thinking,
we could drive by his house,

480
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:52,025
when he's in his yard,
and shoot him down.

481
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:54,037
Lisa: The cops will think
it's a gang thing.

482
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:55,936
Oh, no.
Somebody will see us.

483
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:59,443
I know. We can go into his house
while he's sleeping,

484
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,034
and stab the fucker
in the neck.

485
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:03,842
- Donny: I brought my survival knife.
- He's got a doberman.

486
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:05,883
The best way
is just to shoot him.

487
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,441
- How do we get a gun?
- My ma has one.

488
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:20,062
Marty: We can't bonk him over
the head and drag him off somewhere.

489
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:21,098
Girl: How come?

490
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,690
He's too strong.

491
00:40:23,768 --> 00:40:25,895
Wait a second.
Haven't you even met him before?

492
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,938
- Girl: No.
- Donny: No, me neither.

493
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:31,338
- Donny: What's this guy like?
- He's an asshole.

494
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:36,839
(gun clicking)

495
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:39,576
Holy shit.
What he fuck is that for?

496
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,278
To kill Bobby Kent,
don't you remember?

497
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:44,287
Donny: Oh, yeah.

498
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,585
Hey, won't that
get blood everywhere?

499
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:48,921
Yeah, we're gonna have to plan
where we're gonna do it.

500
00:40:48,993 --> 00:40:50,688
(knocking on door)

501
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:55,055
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Mrs. Connelly.

502
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:59,698
These are my friends from Palm Bay.
This is Donny and this is Heather.

503
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:02,968
- Hi, Donny. Hi, Heather.
- Hey.

504
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,838
- Did you kids have supper?
- All: Yes ma'am.

505
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:08,639
Okay.

506
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:15,152
Are we really
gonna do this?

507
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,055
Jesus Christ, Ali, can you
get this guy to shut up?

508
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:20,112
Donny: Ow!

509
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:21,681
- Shut up, Donny.
- You shut up!

510
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:23,454
We'll have to find
a way to get him alone.

511
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:25,359
No shit,
he's gotta be by himself.

512
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:29,331
It's easier to kill someone
when they're by themselves.

513
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,163
Yeah.

514
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:33,703
Ali, what if you offer
to fuck him again?

515
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:37,036
Wait a minute, isn't this
the guy who raped you?

516
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:39,338
What do you mean...
like bait?

517
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,502
Yeah.

518
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:42,273
It's not enough
for him to go.

519
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:47,775
What if I offered
to let him dog out my 5.0?

520
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:50,616
- Donny: Excuse me...
- And then offer to fuck me again.

521
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:53,623
He can drive you out to the barrens
in Weston by the Glades.

522
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:55,283
Wait a second...
Okay?

523
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,827
If Ali's supposed
to be banging Bobby,

524
00:41:57,895 --> 00:41:59,522
then what the fuck
is Donny doing here?

525
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:03,055
Marty: Seriously, the guy's
just gonna go and kick it,

526
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:05,068
while somebody else
screws his chick?

527
00:42:05,136 --> 00:42:06,660
Marty: Nobody's
that big of a dweeb.

528
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:10,104
- (girls giggling)
- He's right.

529
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:16,146
Holy shit, I could...

530
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:18,648
We could say that
I'm Heather's boyfriend.

531
00:42:18,716 --> 00:42:19,978
You know?

532
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,910
Donny:
That's good, right?

533
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:30,960
- Marty: Hey?
- Hey.

534
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:34,395
- Marty: What're you doing?
- Homework.

535
00:42:34,465 --> 00:42:35,591
Marty: No shit.

536
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:39,035
Well, I'm over
at Lisa's house,

537
00:42:39,103 --> 00:42:43,437
and that Ali chick
is down here.

538
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:47,238
- I think she wants you.
- Bobby: What are you taking about?

539
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:49,674
Hold on.

540
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:53,240
Hey Bob,
what's going on?

541
00:42:53,317 --> 00:42:54,249
Bobby: Hey!

542
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:56,978
Bobby:
You're not pissed off?

543
00:42:57,054 --> 00:43:00,615
No, I liked it, actually.
I've been thinking about it.

544
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:02,124
Maybe we could get
together.

545
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:05,594
We could take my 5.0 out
and get ballistic or something.

546
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:09,530
(Ali moaning)

547
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:12,897
Marty: What's up?

548
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,063
Bobby: Marty,
what's with this shit?

549
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:17,073
I don't know.
I guess she digs you.

550
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:20,542
You got me jealous over here.
She's fuckin' fine.

551
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:25,649
Hey, you're there
with fuckface?

552
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:31,113
- Marty: Yeah.
- Bobby: Oh. Sick.

553
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,953
Okay, we do it and just roll
the body into the canal.

554
00:43:36,027 --> 00:43:37,722
That's out
by the Glades.

555
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:39,763
The gators will eat
his ass for lunch.

556
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,762
Here.

557
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:43,527
What are you
giving me that for?

558
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:45,296
You're in the best
position to do it.

559
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:47,337
You fuck him, then right
when he's gonna come,

560
00:43:47,405 --> 00:43:49,430
- you blow his brains out.
- Oh, shit.

561
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:52,476
- Heather: That's cool.
- You're the one that wants him dead.

562
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,443
You want him dead too.

563
00:43:54,512 --> 00:43:56,275
It's too risky
if I do it.

564
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:58,508
I'd have to follow him.
He might hear me coming.

565
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:02,776
Here, take it.

566
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:04,377
I'll be close by.

567
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:06,150
You shoot him,
we'll ditch the body.

568
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:09,720
All right, fuck it.
Let's go!

569
00:44:31,382 --> 00:44:33,543
Hey, Bobby.
I'm Heather's girl...

570
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:34,982
boyfriend... Fuck!

571
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:38,920
Hey Don...
uh, Bobby...

572
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:42,653
I'm Donny, this is Heather...
I'm... I'm her boyfriend.

573
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:43,694
Yeah.

574
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:44,819
- That's good?
- Yeah.

575
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:46,658
I was thinking
we'd go out to Weston

576
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:48,426
and mess around
in those new developments

577
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:50,330
and dog out
my 5.0 or some shit.

578
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:52,460
I'll give these two
a ride back.

579
00:44:54,538 --> 00:44:56,096
Wait a second,
you're not coming?

580
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:59,506
No, man.
I'm fucking worked.

581
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:01,306
What about her?

582
00:45:01,379 --> 00:45:04,314
- I'm coming with you.
- Bobby: No, man!

583
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:07,010
I don't want your bitch
coming along with us.

584
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:09,348
Ali: Come on, Bobby.
She's my homie.

585
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,014
I haven't seen her
in a long time and...

586
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:14,785
we need to talk about some shit
on the way out anyway.

587
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:17,754
What?

588
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:19,489
Hey, Bobby.

589
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:24,796
I'm Donny, this is Heather.
I'm fucking her.

590
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:29,335
Okay, whatever,
I'm driving.

591
00:45:42,486 --> 00:45:44,113
Goodbye, asshole.

592
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:52,423
You don't want
to dog it out some more?

593
00:45:52,496 --> 00:45:57,058
- I mean, it is a 5.0.
- This ain't a 5.0, bitch.

594
00:45:58,502 --> 00:46:01,994
How about
I dog you out? Huh?

595
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:07,475
What the fuck did we come
all the way out here for, then?

596
00:46:10,748 --> 00:46:11,908
Fuck!

597
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:17,385
How about you give me
a fucking blowjob, now?

598
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,724
What are you fucking
bitches talking about?

599
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:25,553
I'm going for a walk.

600
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,698
(nervous laughter)

601
00:46:28,766 --> 00:46:31,792
Shit, you got a fuckin'
irritating laugh, bitch.

602
00:47:21,752 --> 00:47:25,415
- TV host: Miss Tennessee.
- (audience applauding)

603
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:35,624
- Heather: So, is he dead?
- Nope, Lisa chickened out.

604
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:36,631
Fuck I did.

605
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:41,137
Yo, Marty, check out Miss Texas.
She's so fuckin' hot!

606
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:46,599
- You couldn't do it?
- Lisa: No, I just thought of something.

607
00:47:46,677 --> 00:47:49,271
On "Homicide" they can take
a bullet out of the body

608
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:50,813
and trace it back
to the murder weapon.

609
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:53,372
If I use my mom's gun,
they can find out I did it.

610
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,884
- So then toss it!
- Toss what?

611
00:47:55,953 --> 00:47:58,478
The gun, into the ocean, and
then they can't trace the bullet.

612
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:01,616
I can't do that.
My ma'd kill me.

613
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:03,387
You're bullshit too,
bitch.

614
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,758
- I am not.
- Are so.

615
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:08,627
I think you're all
fuckin' bullshit.

616
00:48:16,073 --> 00:48:18,473
You guys need
professional help.

617
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:22,406
(Heather giggling)
Shit.

618
00:48:33,691 --> 00:48:34,988
Man:
What's this shit?

619
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:38,119
- I thought you were professionals.
- We are fuckin' professionals.

620
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:40,595
Why are you giving us shit
we can't use?

621
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:53,536
(bike bell ringing)

622
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:03,745
- Who is it?
- Some girl named Ali.

623
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:05,311
Ali?

624
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:06,686
Hey, Ali.
What's up?

625
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,953
Sure as hell don't sound
like a sanctioned hit.

626
00:49:14,331 --> 00:49:16,299
You can come over
to talk about it,

627
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,301
but nothing's set
in stone, all right?

628
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:20,865
All right, cool.

629
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,058
(phone ringing)

630
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:58,665
- Lisa: Hey, it's me.
- What do you want?

631
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:00,642
Derek, I need you
for something big.

632
00:50:00,711 --> 00:50:03,942
- Derek: My truck's broken.
- Fuck your truck, I need you.

633
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:07,283
Then I need a ride.

634
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:12,186
(rap music playing)
(honking)

635
00:50:14,258 --> 00:50:16,123
Donny:
Come on, come on.

636
00:50:26,937 --> 00:50:29,337
- Donny: You're in, dude?
- Heather: Let's go.

637
00:50:31,008 --> 00:50:32,737
Hey, I'm Heather.

638
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:42,242
You wanna hit this?

639
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:49,319
So what do you do, man?
What's your thing?

640
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:50,758
What do you do?

641
00:50:50,828 --> 00:50:54,264
- I do "Combat."
- Oh shit, "Combat"?

642
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:57,095
I fuckin' love combat.
I like to drop acid and play.

643
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:00,932
That's cool.

644
00:51:01,004 --> 00:51:03,404
So. You got
a place to play at?

645
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:07,740
Yeah, DNA Comics.
Across the street from Lisa's house.

646
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:11,303
- Got any acid?
- Yeah I got some acid, bro'.

647
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,144
Open... aaah.

648
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:20,349
Here you go, man.

649
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:26,925
All right.
Take us to DNA, Heather.

650
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,904
- Blasted!
- Wasted!

651
00:51:38,976 --> 00:51:40,603
Both: Busted!

652
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:42,372
I think these guys
have been experimenting

653
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:44,209
with some
controlled substances.

654
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:45,543
You aren'tjust
whistling dixie.

655
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:48,608
Come on, get the fuck
out of the way.

656
00:51:48,685 --> 00:51:51,085
Boy: Big floppy
donkey dick bully.

657
00:51:52,723 --> 00:51:54,816
Computerized voice:
Choose your fighter.

658
00:51:54,892 --> 00:51:57,190
Fight to the death.

659
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,331
- You're Marty, right?
- Yeah.

660
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:13,899
I've watched you
surf North Beach.

661
00:52:13,977 --> 00:52:15,239
No shit?

662
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:17,246
I like to rollerblade
down there a lot.

663
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:20,612
Look like you get a good
workout from rollerblading.

664
00:52:20,684 --> 00:52:21,742
Thanks.

665
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,151
Bobby: Marty?

666
00:52:24,221 --> 00:52:26,280
You gotta get
back to work.

667
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:27,823
I'll be there
in a minute, man.

668
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:32,026
I've never
rollerbladed before.

669
00:52:32,095 --> 00:52:35,792
We'll go sometime.
I'll teach you.

670
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:40,560
Here, let me
give you my number.

671
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:41,661
Please do.

672
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:45,708
What about your chick
at home, man?

673
00:52:45,776 --> 00:52:47,767
That fat bitch
with your baby?

674
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:50,741
I mean it's...

675
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:57,745
Well I guess
I should be going now. Bye.

676
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:04,056
I work right here.

677
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:08,496
This is my lunch break,
if you ever wanna come visit me.

678
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:11,225
What a cunt!

679
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:21,510
(video game playing)

680
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:28,451
- Derek: Fatalize.
- Donny: Fatalize, fatalize.

681
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,356
Computerized voice:
Fatalize.

682
00:53:34,424 --> 00:53:37,257
Boy #1: He's gonna hurl.
- Boy #2: Oh, shit.

683
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:39,488
I got it. I got it.

684
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,592
Fucking A, man.
You fucking fatalized the guy.

685
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,606
(boys jeering and razzing)

686
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:53,404
What the fuck, man...
What the fuck does fatalize mean?

687
00:53:53,477 --> 00:53:56,412
- Does it mean death?
- No dude, it's worse.

688
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,210
Way worse, because
you have to live, man.

689
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:02,218
You have to live and
you're like a fuckin' baby.

690
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:04,311
Fuck, man!

691
00:54:05,822 --> 00:54:07,050
Shit!

692
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:12,028
- Let's go help my cousin.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

693
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:14,063
Shit!

694
00:54:25,342 --> 00:54:28,072
Girls:
Ew! Gross, yuck!

695
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:30,374
Sorry.

696
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:33,514
What's up, guys?

697
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:36,278
Sorry.

698
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:40,084
Ali: Go away.
Go away right now.

699
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:44,484
Go away?
Give me a kiss.

700
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:46,290
No, eeww!

701
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:49,992
Jesus Christ, you guys
should have seen what Derek did.

702
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:53,264
He turned this guy
into a baby.

703
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:56,306
Close your mouth
when you eat, Jesus!

704
00:54:56,373 --> 00:54:58,238
Donny: Is this like
a joke or something?

705
00:54:58,308 --> 00:55:00,776
No, it isn't a joke.
I know this guy, he's in a gang.

706
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:01,902
A hitman?

707
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,844
Ali: No doubt.

708
00:55:25,002 --> 00:55:26,663
(honking)

709
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:31,674
- (honking)
- Damn it!

710
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,748
(honking)

711
00:55:47,557 --> 00:55:48,819
I got it, Dad.

712
00:55:49,993 --> 00:55:53,690
Shit! Lay off the horn.
You're blasting my whole neighborhood.

713
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:56,628
What's up, Ali?

714
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,632
Nothing.

715
00:55:57,701 --> 00:56:00,761
We need to know if you can
get those guns for us, man.

716
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:03,271
Hitman: You need
to give me a little time.

717
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,501
Can'tjust snap
your fingers and shit.

718
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:09,670
- Guns are hard to come by.
- I can get you some money.

719
00:56:09,746 --> 00:56:12,374
Hitman: Oh yeah? Whose piggy bank
are you gonna rob?

720
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:16,642
Come on, you know
you can trust us.

721
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:22,286
Why do it with a gun?

722
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:24,293
Lisa: Itjust seemed
like the easy way to do it.

723
00:56:24,361 --> 00:56:27,694
Hitman: You need to chill out
and plan this out a little better.

724
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:29,061
Lisa:
No, I wanna do it now.

725
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:31,225
God damn it, I want
the son of a bitch dead.

726
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:32,928
I want his sorry ass
dead tonight.

727
00:56:34,004 --> 00:56:35,232
Do you understand me?

728
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:38,666
Hitman:
All right, look...

729
00:56:38,742 --> 00:56:40,710
maybe I can help you,
but I don't know.

730
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:44,276
First you guys need
some weapons and shit.

731
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:46,611
You should think about
planning this out better.

732
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:50,653
Then, when you get all that done,
then you can come see me.

733
00:56:50,721 --> 00:56:53,053
Hitman: I have a window
around the rear.

734
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:55,421
Just come by and
knock a little lightly.

735
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:57,050
I'll be there.

736
00:56:57,127 --> 00:57:00,324
Donny: Like a signal, right?
Like in Tom Sawyer.

737
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:05,061
(scattered laughter)

738
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:09,500
My normal suppliers, they won't
help out with this shit.

739
00:57:09,573 --> 00:57:12,201
Maybe I'll just come and
supervise, I don't know.

740
00:57:12,275 --> 00:57:14,368
But either way,
you got a weapons problem.

741
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:22,885
I swear to God, I can't wait
to stab that motherfucker.

742
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:25,854
Slit his throat and
bleed him like a pig.

743
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:27,753
I'm gonna slice
his guts open,

744
00:57:27,824 --> 00:57:29,951
spill his intestines
out on the dirt,

745
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:31,584
beat him in the head
with a baseball bat

746
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:33,128
until
his eyeballs fall out.

747
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:38,365
If you won't do it, I'll do it.
I'll cut the fucker for you.

748
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:41,666
I'll do it. I'll fuckin'...
I'll kill... I'll...

749
00:57:41,738 --> 00:57:43,672
I'll do it
if you won't do it.

750
00:57:52,449 --> 00:57:55,179
So weird.
This shit's so weird.

751
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:04,019
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Aunt Mo.

752
00:58:04,094 --> 00:58:07,689
Mrs. Connelly: Still here, Ali?
Don't you have a baby to take care of?

753
00:58:07,764 --> 00:58:11,063
- She's on her way back.
- She should get her stuff and go, then.

754
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:14,002
You guys don't work.

755
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,732
You don't go to school,
you don't do anything.

756
00:58:16,807 --> 00:58:20,436
All you do is lay around
and drive your cars,

757
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:22,375
and eat us out
of house and home.

758
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:24,174
You know
how that makes me feel?

759
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:29,110
- Mad!
- (chuckling)

760
00:58:36,092 --> 00:58:37,992
The fuck are we
gonna do now, man?

761
00:58:38,061 --> 00:58:39,528
Just calm the fuck down.

762
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:50,640
- Heather: Ow, my butt!
- Donny: Fuck, Ali. This sucks.

763
00:58:50,707 --> 00:58:52,106
Ali:
Don't worry about it.

764
00:58:52,175 --> 00:58:54,575
We'll park around the corner
until Lisa's mom leaves.

765
00:58:57,981 --> 00:58:59,539
You're not
with Ali, are you?

766
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:04,846
- Not unless I lose some weight.
- You've always had common sense.

767
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:09,457
I'm glad to see you
hanging out with Lisa.

768
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:12,857
I'm surprised,
but glad.

769
00:59:15,065 --> 00:59:16,464
You like her friends?

770
00:59:18,902 --> 00:59:19,891
I don't know.

771
00:59:21,104 --> 00:59:24,767
I mean, they get a little crazy,
sometimes, but...

772
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:27,969
I'm just hanging out.

773
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:28,908
Good.

774
00:59:30,413 --> 00:59:33,644
You know, when we lived in the Bronx,
at least we had a family.

775
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:36,583
Family kept things
tight and safe.

776
00:59:37,654 --> 00:59:42,523
Down here in Florida, nobody's tight.
Everybody's just... whatever.

777
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:46,761
Don't Ali's parents
wonder where she is?

778
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:48,798
I don't know.

779
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:53,430
I'm going over to your mother's,
play some cards.

780
01:00:03,246 --> 01:00:04,474
Ali: What?

781
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:06,014
What's the matter?

782
01:00:06,082 --> 01:00:10,143
Nothing, I love you, Ali.
I truly love you.

783
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,279
I do too, Ali.

784
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,490
We're gonna be okay,
guys, you know?

785
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:22,326
We're gonna get
this shit behind us and...

786
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:25,197
we're gonna be back
in time in Palm Bay,

787
01:00:25,268 --> 01:00:27,862
for Donny's birthday
at his mom's house.

788
01:00:27,938 --> 01:00:31,203
Shit, I never knew nobody
who killed somebody.

789
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:34,941
Me neither.

790
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:39,538
Heather: Just my grandpa.
I never knew him.

791
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:41,083
No way?

792
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:44,177
Yeah. My grandpa
was a bad drunk.

793
01:00:44,254 --> 01:00:45,983
Really bad.

794
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:52,323
He'd rape anyone dumb enough
to walk by his room.

795
01:00:52,395 --> 01:00:56,491
One night...
he got...

796
01:00:56,566 --> 01:01:00,058
really pissed at my grandma and
he took a claw hammer to her face.

797
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:08,376
After that, he locked himself
up with her...

798
01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:10,913
in his room
for two whole days...

799
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:16,044
and he kept drinking and having sex
with her after she was dead.

800
01:01:17,687 --> 01:01:20,087
My mom was in the house
the whole time.

801
01:01:20,156 --> 01:01:23,819
- Fuck.
- She was only 15.

802
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:30,557
Holy shit.

803
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:33,261
You know, it really
messed with her head.

804
01:01:33,336 --> 01:01:39,297
After that, she only hung out with guys
who beat the hell out of her.

805
01:01:39,376 --> 01:01:41,606
And then,
when I was little,

806
01:01:41,678 --> 01:01:43,976
she'd get drunk and
she'd drag me and my brother

807
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:46,709
out of bed at four
in the morning and...

808
01:01:46,783 --> 01:01:50,583
she had all the news clippings
about my grandpa...

809
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:54,521
and she'd read them
over and over again.

810
01:01:54,591 --> 01:01:58,527
I knew every word
before kindergarten.

811
01:01:59,629 --> 01:02:01,688
I think that's how
I learned to read.

812
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:08,737
She's gone.
We should go.

813
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:12,970
That chick Ali gave me
a blowjob, last night.

814
01:02:13,043 --> 01:02:17,241
- And I fucked her.
- Cool.

815
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:19,144
She called again.

816
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:21,376
Says you all are going
back out to Weston.

817
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:23,782
Marty?

818
01:02:23,853 --> 01:02:26,321
Yeah man,
that's the plan.

819
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:27,617
Are you going out?

820
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:34,554
Hey, man?
You're my best friend.

821
01:02:35,632 --> 01:02:36,599
Right?

822
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:38,701
Yeah.

823
01:02:59,122 --> 01:03:01,647
Okay, we're picking
Marty up in 45 minutes.

824
01:03:01,724 --> 01:03:03,385
Derek, what's up
with the baseball bat?

825
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:07,863
Lisa: Come on,
we need more weapons.

826
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:12,991
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

827
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:17,062
- My ma said something?
- No, it's just...

828
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:20,574
Never mind,
everything's okay.

829
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:30,786
My back hurts.
I have a tension backache.

830
01:03:30,854 --> 01:03:33,379
Derek, will you
give me a massage?

831
01:03:38,962 --> 01:03:42,398
Me too, my back hurts too.
I want a massage.

832
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:43,693
Ali: Harder.

833
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:46,132
- Derek: Like that?
- Ali: Hmmm!

834
01:03:53,676 --> 01:03:54,973
Watch it!

835
01:03:58,381 --> 01:03:59,507
I guess I'll...

836
01:04:00,783 --> 01:04:03,479
Okay, I guess I'll go
do something about the bats.

837
01:04:03,553 --> 01:04:04,986
Good idea.

838
01:04:11,561 --> 01:04:13,791
Okay, there's one thing
left to do.

839
01:04:13,863 --> 01:04:17,458
- Ali: What's that?
- The hitman needs a ride.

840
01:04:26,176 --> 01:04:28,110
Mr. Kent: Where are you
going tonight, Bob?

841
01:04:28,178 --> 01:04:30,305
Going out
with my friend.

842
01:04:32,649 --> 01:04:34,014
Need any money?

843
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:36,051
No Dad.
I'm cool, thanks.

844
01:04:54,037 --> 01:04:56,164
Marty, could I use
your bathroom?

845
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:57,866
- Number one or two?
- Derek: One.

846
01:04:57,941 --> 01:04:59,374
Just go in the alley.

847
01:05:01,644 --> 01:05:03,441
- What's up, man?
- How's it going?

848
01:05:03,513 --> 01:05:08,075
CMF, CMF, what the fuck?
What does that mean, CMF?

849
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:10,051
Lisa: Didn't we already
tell him what it means?

850
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:11,381
What's with this guy?

851
01:05:11,454 --> 01:05:13,786
- What does it mean?
- It means Crazy MotherFucker.

852
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:15,585
It's like
"The Godfather"...

853
01:05:15,658 --> 01:05:17,785
- A division of the Davy Boyz.
- Oh, shit!

854
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:21,728
Fuckin' Godfather,
Crazy MotherFuckers. Holy shit!

855
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:23,356
Crazy MotherFuckers, huh?

856
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:25,094
- Donny: Holy shit!
- Hey, man?

857
01:05:25,168 --> 01:05:27,659
- Think this is heavy enough?
- To kill a guy?

858
01:05:27,737 --> 01:05:30,604
- Yeah.
- Maybe, if you hit him right.

859
01:05:30,673 --> 01:05:32,072
You mean in the back
of the head or some shit?

860
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:34,666
It don't matter. You just gotta
hit him hard enough.

861
01:05:34,744 --> 01:05:36,336
Yeah,
I guess that's the key.

862
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:37,436
Yeah.

863
01:05:37,513 --> 01:05:40,710
You can'tjust smack the motherfucker,
you've got to really wack him!

864
01:05:40,783 --> 01:05:42,614
It's not like in a fight
and you're mad at him.

865
01:05:42,685 --> 01:05:46,086
You're not trying to hurt him.
You're trying to kill him.

866
01:05:47,156 --> 01:05:48,384
Marty:
I got something else.

867
01:05:50,226 --> 01:05:51,488
See, that's cool!

868
01:05:51,561 --> 01:05:52,858
Hitman:
It's Marty, right?

869
01:05:52,929 --> 01:05:54,362
- Donny: Yo!
- Marty: Yeah.

870
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:57,399
Donny: What about this shit?
This shit is good enough?

871
01:05:57,467 --> 01:05:59,162
Right here, right here.

872
01:06:01,004 --> 01:06:03,370
Hitman: What the fuck for?
You're gonna play baseball?

873
01:06:03,439 --> 01:06:06,135
- No!
- Then why the fuck you got a bat?

874
01:06:06,209 --> 01:06:07,870
What are you
gonna do with that?

875
01:06:07,944 --> 01:06:10,071
- For the guy!
- What guy?

876
01:06:10,146 --> 01:06:11,113
Bobby Kent!

877
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,239
- What about Bobby Kent?
- The guy we're going to kill!

878
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:16,911
Is this bat good enough
to ram his fuckin' head in?

879
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:18,977
- Hitman: I don't know, man.
- How about this knife?

880
01:06:19,055 --> 01:06:21,421
This knife is good, right?
I tried to sharpen it but...

881
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:25,052
- Hitman: I don't know, man!
- All right, fuck!

882
01:06:25,128 --> 01:06:27,688
Are we going
just to fight this guy,

883
01:06:27,764 --> 01:06:29,322
or are we gonna
kill him?

884
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:31,867
I want him dead tonight and
I don't want any bullshit!

885
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:37,930
Yeah, I mean, this is
the son of a bitch that raped Ali.

886
01:06:38,007 --> 01:06:40,532
- He fuckin' raped her!
- Yeah, just think about it.

887
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:42,544
He won't even
let Marty have a life.

888
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:45,274
He beats him every time he does
something Bobby doesn't like.

889
01:06:45,348 --> 01:06:46,212
Do you fuckin' mind?

890
01:06:46,282 --> 01:06:48,375
He won't even let him
see his own family.

891
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:51,153
That sucks.

892
01:06:52,922 --> 01:06:54,389
This guy
deserves to die.

893
01:06:54,457 --> 01:06:57,255
He does deserve it.
Agreed.

894
01:06:57,327 --> 01:06:59,056
So we're notjust
gonna scare him.

895
01:06:59,128 --> 01:07:01,392
- We're gonna kill him?
- Donny: We're gonna kill him!

896
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:04,799
I want this motherfucker dead,
you understand me?

897
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:07,927
(snapping fingers)
I want this motherfucker dead.

898
01:07:08,004 --> 01:07:12,168
Donny: Let's fuckin' kill him,
fuckin' kill him!

899
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:15,233
Donny: Dead!
Let's kill the motherfucker.

900
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:18,212
- All: Dead! Dead! Dead!
- Dead.

901
01:07:18,281 --> 01:07:20,374
Dead! We're gonna
kill this fucker.

902
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:21,940
All: Dead! Dead!
Dead! Dead...

903
01:07:22,018 --> 01:07:24,919
Oh, shit, sorry. Go ahead.
I'm gonna fuckin' lose it.

904
01:07:24,987 --> 01:07:25,919
Go ahead.

905
01:07:28,324 --> 01:07:30,849
You people need to understand
some shit here.

906
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:31,985
What?

907
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:33,323
This isn't a game.

908
01:07:33,396 --> 01:07:35,125
We're not a bunch of kids
playing make believe.

909
01:07:35,198 --> 01:07:37,792
- Who says we're playing?
- Come down, all right?

910
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:40,233
You guys got to understand
that me and my people,

911
01:07:40,303 --> 01:07:41,736
we're what you call
serious people.

912
01:07:41,804 --> 01:07:43,829
And you do know what
I mean when I say serious.

913
01:07:43,906 --> 01:07:45,931
- We understand what you...
- What does it mean?

914
01:07:46,008 --> 01:07:48,499
- Enlighten me.
- It means you ain't playing.

915
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:51,046
I said from the beginning
that I'd kill this dude.

916
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:52,809
I was the first one
to say it.

917
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:55,373
So don't fuckin' treat me
like I'm a kid, okay?

918
01:07:56,452 --> 01:07:57,510
What about you?

919
01:07:57,587 --> 01:08:00,715
This guy? Dude, this fuckin'
kid is cold, man.

920
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:03,554
I've been hangin' out with him
for only a couple days,

921
01:08:03,626 --> 01:08:07,118
I've seen this guy do shit
you wouldn't believe.

922
01:08:08,431 --> 01:08:09,728
He's cold.

923
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:11,562
All right, that's good.

924
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:14,863
- Yeah, that's real good.
- (door opening)

925
01:08:14,937 --> 01:08:16,234
- Hi, Mom!
- Hey, Loverbug.

926
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:17,670
Mother: What are you kids
doing tonight?

927
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,469
Marty: Probably going
to the movies.

928
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:21,737
- Mother: Drive safe, okay?
- Marty: I will.

929
01:08:23,112 --> 01:08:24,875
Mother: Be careful
with my car, honey.

930
01:08:24,947 --> 01:08:26,278
Okay, Mom.

931
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:49,237
What's going on, man?

932
01:08:49,305 --> 01:08:51,899
You tell me, dude.
Who are these fuckin' assholes?

933
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:54,738
Just some fuckin' dudes
Ali brought down from Palm Bay.

934
01:08:54,811 --> 01:08:57,541
Some dudes.
What the fuck, man?

935
01:08:57,613 --> 01:09:00,343
I thought you said
she wanted to fuck me.

936
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:02,111
She does, dude.
That's the fuck she wants.

937
01:09:02,185 --> 01:09:03,482
That's all she's been
talking about.

938
01:09:03,553 --> 01:09:05,180
We're just gonna
dog out the rides.

939
01:09:05,254 --> 01:09:07,381
See if the Mustang
can take my old lady's ride.

940
01:09:09,058 --> 01:09:10,889
That's fuckin' stupid.

941
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,360
What kind of race
is that, man?

942
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:16,091
Why don't you chill, Bobby?
Goddamn, dude.

943
01:09:16,165 --> 01:09:19,532
We'll go out to the dunes
where you guys were last time.

944
01:09:19,602 --> 01:09:21,570
You didn't do
so bad then, did you?

945
01:09:21,637 --> 01:09:22,569
Huh?

946
01:09:23,906 --> 01:09:25,203
All right, man.

947
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:37,986
Get in the back, bitch.
I'm driving this piece of shit.

948
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:44,382
Damn.
Keep you in mind.

949
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:51,124
Show me how
to shift this thing.

950
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:57,933
- Ali: You're so hot!
- I'm not hot, baby, I'm just big.

951
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,236
(tires screeching)

952
01:10:02,311 --> 01:10:04,302
Hitman: That guy's an asshole
to be driving like that.

953
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,076
Lisa: Tell me about it.
We've got to kill that fucker.

954
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:12,549
- All right, I love these dudes.
- I love them too, man.

955
01:10:12,622 --> 01:10:15,318
They're so good. Did you see them
when they were down here?

956
01:10:15,391 --> 01:10:17,256
Fuck yeah, man.
You?

957
01:10:18,661 --> 01:10:22,654
I went down to the show with my friend
and we got so fucked up.

958
01:10:22,732 --> 01:10:25,257
So did the whole fuckin'
crowd, man.

959
01:10:25,334 --> 01:10:29,031
They had this fat Chinese guy
on stage with them...

960
01:10:29,105 --> 01:10:30,732
Buddha dude! Buddha dude!

961
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:33,536
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah.
- He was a fuckin' Buddha dude!

962
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:38,308
He had this huge marijuana leaf
on his stomach, you know?

963
01:10:38,381 --> 01:10:41,509
Yeah, man. Then they played
this one song...

964
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:44,246
and the whole fuckin' crowd
lit up at once.

965
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,221
Marijuana, just fuckin'
smoking, everybody.

966
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,917
I lit up too.

967
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:52,691
- Right on.
- Ali: We might as well get high.

968
01:10:56,766 --> 01:10:58,791
What did that dude
mean earlier when he said

969
01:10:58,868 --> 01:11:01,098
he had seen you
do some amazing shit?

970
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:04,833
Me? I don't know what
that dude thinks he saw me do.

971
01:11:04,907 --> 01:11:07,967
- Derek: Could be anything.
- Hitman: Yeah but what exactly?

972
01:11:08,044 --> 01:11:10,444
Did you do somebody
or something?

973
01:11:10,513 --> 01:11:12,981
I kind of got down
on a guy earlier today.

974
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:14,346
You killed him?

975
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:17,284
No, it wasn't anything like that.
It was at the mall.

976
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:21,081
I put a little
disciplinary action on him.

977
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:23,756
Disciplinary action.

978
01:11:24,827 --> 01:11:25,851
I like that.

979
01:11:25,928 --> 01:11:28,089
You put some
disciplinary action on him.

980
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:29,324
Yeah.

981
01:11:34,537 --> 01:11:37,631
What's your deal, man?
Huh?

982
01:11:37,707 --> 01:11:41,871
- Donny: What?
- Why are you here?

983
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:49,882
I am...

984
01:11:51,821 --> 01:11:54,619
He's Heather's boyfriend.
He's here with her.

985
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,317
Yeah.

986
01:11:59,328 --> 01:12:03,128
- You live in Palm Bay?
- Yep.

987
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,497
So why...
I mean what's your...

988
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:09,401
What's your deal?
Why did you come down?

989
01:12:11,107 --> 01:12:12,438
I...

990
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:15,668
I don't know.

991
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:20,039
Ali: To see what a fine
looking man I'm going out with.

992
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:21,913
- Yeah.
- (girls giggling)

993
01:12:24,053 --> 01:12:27,250
- You call that going out?
- I don't know.

994
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:31,153
I call it
a fuckin' blowjob.

995
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:35,489
Damn fine blowjob,
but a blowjob all the same.

996
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:39,762
What do you mean by going out?
What the hell's your definition?

997
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:42,895
I don't fuckin' know.
What's your name again, Feather?

998
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:46,100
My name's not Feather,
it's Heather.

999
01:12:47,243 --> 01:12:49,643
All right. Let me ask you
a question, Heather.

1000
01:12:49,712 --> 01:12:52,146
Are you a hooker here,
like your friend?

1001
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:53,841
- Donny: Oh, shit.
- Shit.

1002
01:12:57,653 --> 01:12:58,745
Bobby: Huh?

1003
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:03,258
You know what?
You better watch your mouth...

1004
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:06,851
or my boyfriend
will be real pissed at you.

1005
01:13:08,364 --> 01:13:10,832
Who's that?
Lonny back there?

1006
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,562
You're talking about Lonny
in the back seat?

1007
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:15,661
He's gonna get mad
at me and then what?

1008
01:13:15,738 --> 01:13:18,605
What's he gonna do then?
What are you gonna do, Lonny?

1009
01:13:20,142 --> 01:13:21,336
It's Donny, dude.

1010
01:13:23,412 --> 01:13:25,778
It's definitely Donny.

1011
01:13:25,848 --> 01:13:28,248
Yeah, whatever. You know
your girlfriend's a hooker?

1012
01:13:29,418 --> 01:13:30,350
For real.

1013
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:34,719
That teen prostitution bust,
two years back?

1014
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,953
They were 14,
they got busted.

1015
01:13:38,027 --> 01:13:40,052
That was these two holes
turning tricks

1016
01:13:40,129 --> 01:13:42,290
for crusty old men
at $100 a pop.

1017
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:44,996
For real.

1018
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:48,594
Marty tells me you guys have turned
a few tricks yourselves.

1019
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,600
What?

1020
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:56,638
Is that what Marty Puccio
said about me?

1021
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:06,717
So? We're gonna beat
the shit out of this guy or what?

1022
01:14:08,724 --> 01:14:12,421
I don't know, bro'.
They say they want to kill him.

1023
01:14:19,335 --> 01:14:22,600
- How do think it's gonna go down?
- Hitman: You're talking to me?

1024
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:25,367
Yeah, we got what?
You, me, Donny and Derek.

1025
01:14:25,441 --> 01:14:26,772
Wait, who's Donny?

1026
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:28,867
Ali's boyfriend
from Palm Bay.

1027
01:14:28,944 --> 01:14:31,504
Geez! That guy's
fuckin' retarded.

1028
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,481
Lisa: No, he just gets high a lot.
He's as normal as you and me.

1029
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,484
Shit, that may not be
saying too much.

1030
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:40,447
We brought you here 'cause
you're supposed to be the gangster,

1031
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:42,991
- and the hitman and all that.
- Yeah.

1032
01:14:43,058 --> 01:14:45,049
- Well?
- Well?

1033
01:14:45,127 --> 01:14:46,617
So, what do we do?

1034
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:49,129
We're gonna need a plan,
like a signal.

1035
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:51,564
The fuck you mean,
like a signal?

1036
01:14:51,634 --> 01:14:54,797
You get the guy out here
telling you're gonna race cars,

1037
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:56,667
but the real reason
he's here is for the bitch.

1038
01:14:56,739 --> 01:14:59,537
- The bitch?
- He thinks he's gonna fuck Ali.

1039
01:14:59,608 --> 01:15:02,805
We need to get Ali
to lead him off somewhere,

1040
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:04,402
and then we'll
sneak up from behind.

1041
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,005
- Then we give the signal.
- And then what?

1042
01:15:07,082 --> 01:15:08,379
Then we kill him.

1043
01:15:09,485 --> 01:15:12,477
- So, what's the signal?
- I don't know.

1044
01:15:12,555 --> 01:15:15,718
We'll have to wait 'til I get there,
so I can check out the scene.

1045
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:17,418
This has
to be done right.

1046
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:26,334
Let's take a walk.

1047
01:15:28,037 --> 01:15:29,470
Let's do it.

1048
01:15:51,227 --> 01:15:52,785
Marty: He's gonna tell us
what to do.

1049
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:55,695
Yeah,
I got a few ideas.

1050
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:58,665
I can't believe we're doing this.
My adrenaline's...

1051
01:15:58,734 --> 01:16:00,167
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

1052
01:16:00,236 --> 01:16:02,101
Heather: You shouldn't
yell like that.

1053
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:05,106
It's not like someone's
gonna hear us out here.

1054
01:16:05,174 --> 01:16:07,005
You know what?
You shouldn't yell...

1055
01:16:07,076 --> 01:16:10,477
because someone could hear and
think someone's getting killed...

1056
01:16:10,546 --> 01:16:12,309
I'll keep that
in mind, Heather.

1057
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:14,076
Hitman:
Who else has a weapon?

1058
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:18,684
You still got that knife?

1059
01:16:18,754 --> 01:16:20,187
- Yeah.
- So get it out!

1060
01:16:22,324 --> 01:16:23,791
Do you plan
on doing anything?

1061
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,191
Fuckin' right.

1062
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:30,432
So what?
What do you want us to do?

1063
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:32,433
I don't know.
What do you wanna do?

1064
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:35,834
- I want this fucker dead now.
- I understand that.

1065
01:16:36,906 --> 01:16:38,430
Here's what I think
we should do.

1066
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:41,499
We're gonna need a signal,
so Heather...

1067
01:16:41,577 --> 01:16:44,102
you walk down there like
you're gonna talk to them.

1068
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:47,376
When you see that everything's okay,
that he doesn't suspect shit...

1069
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:50,680
then you yell out "Are there
any alligators down there?"

1070
01:16:50,753 --> 01:16:52,948
When we hear that,
we'll know it's time.

1071
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,325
- Alligators in where?
- In the canal.

1072
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:00,555
It's a signal.

1073
01:17:01,597 --> 01:17:04,122
Just say something about alligators,
all right? Then we'll do him.

1074
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:07,600
I say "alligators"
and then you'll come.

1075
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:09,467
Yeah,
it's a signal.

1076
01:17:09,538 --> 01:17:11,096
- You.
- Yeah.

1077
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:13,664
Go down there like you're her boyfriend,
hold your hand or some shit.

1078
01:17:13,742 --> 01:17:15,903
When you hear
that signal, do it!

1079
01:17:15,978 --> 01:17:17,673
- Okay.
- So, go!

1080
01:17:17,746 --> 01:17:18,940
All right!

1081
01:17:20,883 --> 01:17:23,249
- What do you want me to do?
- You back 'em up.

1082
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:28,188
Donny: Go!

1083
01:17:28,257 --> 01:17:31,158
We'll back them from up here,
so he can't get away.

1084
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:46,435
Uh, yeah...

1085
01:17:46,508 --> 01:17:50,103
Are there
any alligators in there?

1086
01:17:51,246 --> 01:17:52,372
What?

1087
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:55,246
Ali: She asked if
there were any alligators.

1088
01:17:55,317 --> 01:17:58,844
I don't know. Why don't you go
skinny-dip to find out?

1089
01:18:00,923 --> 01:18:03,187
Heather: I asked him if there were
any alligators in there.

1090
01:18:04,693 --> 01:18:06,024
(roar)

1091
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:10,694
Motherfucker!

1092
01:18:13,669 --> 01:18:14,966
God damn it!

1093
01:18:16,472 --> 01:18:17,632
Marty!

1094
01:18:20,175 --> 01:18:21,836
(sobbing)

1095
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,138
Marty!

1096
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:32,547
(Heather screaming)

1097
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:35,684
Please Marty, please!

1098
01:18:35,758 --> 01:18:38,386
Please, whatever I did,
I'm sorry!

1099
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,654
Derek: Just go!

1100
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:45,223
(weeping)

1101
01:18:54,877 --> 01:18:56,606
Hitman:
He can't get away!

1102
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:58,805
Hitman: Get him!

1103
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:03,513
(choking)

1104
01:19:15,364 --> 01:19:17,229
Hitman: Finish him!
Go, go!

1105
01:19:29,244 --> 01:19:32,304
Turn your goddamn
lights off, Ali!

1106
01:19:42,324 --> 01:19:43,757
- What do you want?
- Get out.

1107
01:19:45,427 --> 01:19:46,553
Get fuckin' out!

1108
01:19:48,297 --> 01:19:49,559
Help me carry him.

1109
01:19:50,365 --> 01:19:52,492
Hitman:
Why are you standing around

1110
01:19:52,568 --> 01:19:54,229
instead of doing
what I tell you to do!?

1111
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:58,268
- Is he dead?
- Shut up, Heather.

1112
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,240
- Hitman: Help me pick him up.
- Why?

1113
01:20:00,309 --> 01:20:02,504
Because we gotta get him
out of sight, asshole!

1114
01:20:02,578 --> 01:20:05,274
- Is he dead?
- The fucker's definitely dead.

1115
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:07,941
They just beat his head in
with a baseball bat.

1116
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:11,577
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I don't wanna get blood on my shirt.

1117
01:20:11,653 --> 01:20:13,917
We're not gonna
hug him, asshole!

1118
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:17,322
Grab his feet,
I'll grab his arms.

1119
01:20:21,463 --> 01:20:22,555
What do you wanna do
with him?

1120
01:20:22,631 --> 01:20:24,531
Throw him in the canal.
The gators will get him.

1121
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,364
By the time anyone gets here,
there'll be nothing left to find.

1122
01:20:27,436 --> 01:20:28,664
Donny: Cool.

1123
01:20:29,905 --> 01:20:30,929
Lift!

1124
01:20:32,574 --> 01:20:35,441
- Can we go?
- Just shut up!

1125
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:39,037
- Now what, asshole?
- What?

1126
01:20:39,114 --> 01:20:40,775
This is not too good.

1127
01:20:43,986 --> 01:20:45,613
Derek:
Why isn't he dead?

1128
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:50,021
Just throw him in the water, man.
This kid isn't gonna swim.

1129
01:20:57,332 --> 01:20:58,663
Is he dead yet?

1130
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:00,926
Getting there.

1131
01:21:10,712 --> 01:21:12,145
Take me home now.

1132
01:21:14,283 --> 01:21:15,545
Where's everybody going?

1133
01:21:15,617 --> 01:21:17,278
Where do you think
we're going, Disneyland?

1134
01:21:17,352 --> 01:21:19,411
- We're going home!
- Bullshit!

1135
01:21:19,488 --> 01:21:22,582
Let me tell you.
We better get our alibis straight.

1136
01:21:22,658 --> 01:21:25,957
- I ain't having this pinned on me!
- Right, but we gotta leave

1137
01:21:26,028 --> 01:21:27,222
before someone finds us.

1138
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,287
We'll go to the mall
near my house

1139
01:21:29,364 --> 01:21:31,628
and chill out there and
get our stories straight.

1140
01:21:35,237 --> 01:21:36,295
Marty, you're okay?

1141
01:22:00,996 --> 01:22:03,487
That shit didn't go down right.
People weren't cool!

1142
01:22:03,565 --> 01:22:05,897
We can't go to the mall.

1143
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:08,368
There's too many kids
hanging out there.

1144
01:22:08,437 --> 01:22:10,200
How about North Beach?

1145
01:22:10,272 --> 01:22:12,502
We chill out and get our shit
together about the alibi.

1146
01:22:12,574 --> 01:22:13,836
You better tell them.

1147
01:22:18,347 --> 01:22:19,746
North Beach.

1148
01:22:31,526 --> 01:22:33,619
You shouldn't
feel bad, Ali.

1149
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:36,357
He deserved to die.

1150
01:22:37,866 --> 01:22:40,664
He would have hurt you,
or your baby.

1151
01:22:42,838 --> 01:22:43,770
What do you mean?

1152
01:22:44,906 --> 01:22:47,966
I don't know.
I don't know, I...

1153
01:22:49,077 --> 01:22:54,447
I just don't think you should have
a guilt trip or something.

1154
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:55,448
No?

1155
01:23:05,961 --> 01:23:08,020
Lisa:
It smells like blood.

1156
01:23:08,096 --> 01:23:10,064
What? You're crazy.
I don't smell anything.

1157
01:23:10,132 --> 01:23:11,895
It smells like blood.
You can smell it.

1158
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:13,935
Ali:
I don't smell it.

1159
01:23:14,002 --> 01:23:16,971
Lisa says she smells blood,
then she smells blood.

1160
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:18,097
People are different.

1161
01:23:19,174 --> 01:23:20,732
It fucking stinks.

1162
01:23:20,809 --> 01:23:22,743
Ali: What does blood
smell like, anyway?

1163
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:28,607
I don't know.
But it reeks!

1164
01:23:28,684 --> 01:23:29,708
Lisa?

1165
01:23:32,254 --> 01:23:33,448
What is it, baby?

1166
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:37,281
I forgot the sheath
to my diving knife.

1167
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:39,793
No, you put it behind the bushes,
I saw you.

1168
01:23:39,861 --> 01:23:40,850
Yeah.

1169
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:45,163
- You didn't get it?
- No.

1170
01:23:46,768 --> 01:23:50,204
- I can't go back.
- You have to.

1171
01:23:50,272 --> 01:23:52,638
Marty, they can find
the fingerprints.

1172
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:55,199
But there can be
people there by now.

1173
01:23:55,277 --> 01:23:56,972
Jesus fuckin' Christ,
what now?

1174
01:23:57,045 --> 01:24:00,208
I got to go back.
I left my sheath back there.

1175
01:24:00,282 --> 01:24:01,943
We're gonna have
to go back anyway.

1176
01:24:02,017 --> 01:24:03,314
We didn't cover
the tire tracks,

1177
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:04,909
people might have left
other shit out there.

1178
01:24:04,986 --> 01:24:06,817
We just freaked!
We left too fast.

1179
01:24:06,888 --> 01:24:11,188
- I can't go back there.
- We're not asking you.

1180
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:12,226
Ali?

1181
01:24:19,368 --> 01:24:22,269
You were his best friend.
You'll be the number one suspect.

1182
01:24:22,337 --> 01:24:26,137
That doesn't make sense.
I should be the last they suspect.

1183
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:29,666
You're not a cop!
You don't know how they think.

1184
01:24:29,745 --> 01:24:33,738
They suspect you even if you look
like the most innocent person.

1185
01:24:33,815 --> 01:24:38,275
The more innocent you seem, the more
they get off on fucking with you.

1186
01:24:38,353 --> 01:24:39,820
They get off on that shit.

1187
01:24:43,592 --> 01:24:44,581
Hitman: We're here.

1188
01:24:46,928 --> 01:24:49,021
- Ali: Do you think there's...
- Shhh!

1189
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:55,937
Ready?

1190
01:24:57,706 --> 01:24:59,105
Let's make
this shit fast.

1191
01:24:59,174 --> 01:25:03,406
Police planes stealth around here,
looking for raves and vandals.

1192
01:25:10,051 --> 01:25:12,849
- (door slamming)
- Sorry.

1193
01:25:26,435 --> 01:25:28,426
Jesus, man!
Don't do that.

1194
01:25:28,503 --> 01:25:30,630
- Any luck?
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

1195
01:25:30,705 --> 01:25:32,297
We need to see
if he's still there.

1196
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:36,435
- What the fuck are you...
- No man, we're here right now!

1197
01:25:36,511 --> 01:25:38,376
We need to see
if anybody's found him yet.

1198
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:45,111
Over here!

1199
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:54,620
- Marty: Fuck is that?
- Crabs. They're eating him.

1200
01:25:56,832 --> 01:26:01,292
- (retching)
- That's fuckin' sick. That's gross.

1201
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:03,997
Nature sucks.

1202
01:26:10,946 --> 01:26:12,607
There is blood
on my shoe.

1203
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:14,273
There's blood
on my fuckin' shoe!

1204
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:18,619
Some dog is gonna come down
and dig this stuff up.

1205
01:26:18,687 --> 01:26:20,621
People do that.
They bring their dogs here.

1206
01:26:20,689 --> 01:26:23,317
Even though it's illegal.
The lifeguards don't do shit.

1207
01:26:24,426 --> 01:26:25,518
If someone finds this stuff.

1208
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:27,585
- If someone finds this stuff...
- Chill, Lisa.

1209
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:30,798
You didn't do anything.

1210
01:26:30,866 --> 01:26:34,165
I was there, you didn't do
anything. Neither did I.

1211
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:35,260
Okay?

1212
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:37,560
I definitely didn't.

1213
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:40,130
- (snearing)
- What?

1214
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:42,267
I didn't kill anybody.
I just went along for the ride.

1215
01:26:42,344 --> 01:26:45,677
- You fuckin' drowned the guy!
- I only helped carry the body

1216
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:48,045
'cause that Mafia guy
was gonna beat me.

1217
01:26:48,116 --> 01:26:50,311
- I didn't do shit.
- Neither did I.

1218
01:26:50,385 --> 01:26:52,717
- You stabbed him first!
- Fuck you!

1219
01:26:52,787 --> 01:26:56,951
- The blade went in like that much.
- What about the other 10 times?

1220
01:26:59,794 --> 01:27:01,853
God damn it, Lisa!
Give me the bat back.

1221
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:03,898
I got to return it
or I gotta pay for it.

1222
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:32,252
Where are the knives?

1223
01:27:33,762 --> 01:27:37,357
- I threw them in the ocean.
- You threw them where in the ocean?

1224
01:27:37,432 --> 01:27:39,866
The bitch's been going postal
ever since you left.

1225
01:27:39,935 --> 01:27:41,197
She's crazy, thinks
she's gonna get caught.

1226
01:27:41,269 --> 01:27:42,896
No,
I didn't do shit!

1227
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:44,734
If anyone gets caught,
it'll be you.

1228
01:27:44,806 --> 01:27:46,103
You stabbed him first.

1229
01:27:46,174 --> 01:27:47,573
Shut up!
I didn't do shit.

1230
01:27:47,642 --> 01:27:50,304
So we've been talking about
getting caught, and who did what.

1231
01:27:50,378 --> 01:27:53,006
That's a great talk to have.
We need to have that talk.

1232
01:27:53,081 --> 01:27:54,742
So, what have you
decided?

1233
01:28:01,222 --> 01:28:03,281
You, doper?
What do you think?

1234
01:28:03,358 --> 01:28:05,292
Did you kill
that motherfucker?

1235
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,327
No.

1236
01:28:06,394 --> 01:28:09,693
I mean, I stabbed the dude.
I admit that.

1237
01:28:09,764 --> 01:28:12,289
Everyone saw me do that.
But I didn't...

1238
01:28:12,367 --> 01:28:14,164
I didn't actually
kill him.

1239
01:28:14,235 --> 01:28:16,567
He was still alive after
I finished sticking him.

1240
01:28:16,638 --> 01:28:18,037
You saw the fucker run.

1241
01:28:18,106 --> 01:28:19,164
And you?

1242
01:28:20,609 --> 01:28:22,440
You know
I didn't kill him.

1243
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:24,705
Who helped me drown
the son of bitch, then?

1244
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:27,441
- He was dead already.
- Hitman: Oh, he was dead?

1245
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:29,710
He was so far
fuckin' gone, man.

1246
01:28:30,785 --> 01:28:32,776
I just picked him up
to help you move him.

1247
01:28:32,854 --> 01:28:36,585
I didn't...
I didn't kill anybody.

1248
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:39,091
Ladies?

1249
01:28:41,129 --> 01:28:43,256
Of course not!
You had nothing to do with it,

1250
01:28:43,331 --> 01:28:45,162
you were just
our dates, correct?

1251
01:28:46,368 --> 01:28:48,097
Me and Mr. Marty
have spoken...

1252
01:28:48,169 --> 01:28:50,694
on the way to retrieving the sheath
that was left at the scene.

1253
01:28:50,772 --> 01:28:53,673
The murder scene. You understand
that we murdered somebody?

1254
01:28:53,742 --> 01:28:55,232
We took
your friend's life!

1255
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:56,971
I wanna make sure
we're on the same page.

1256
01:28:59,114 --> 01:29:00,706
I know you fuckin'
smokeheads.

1257
01:29:00,782 --> 01:29:02,306
You're having
your thrills and shit.

1258
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:04,011
This is no fucking
video game.

1259
01:29:04,085 --> 01:29:06,246
Your friend you were
so very pissed at,

1260
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:07,845
he's lying face down
in the swamp,

1261
01:29:07,922 --> 01:29:10,686
with his eyes hanging out
and the crabs eating him.

1262
01:29:10,759 --> 01:29:12,750
I don't intend on going down
for this shit.

1263
01:29:12,827 --> 01:29:16,786
If any of you take me down,
I will kill his ass, or her ass.

1264
01:29:16,865 --> 01:29:19,629
We're gonna sit on
this beach, right now,

1265
01:29:19,701 --> 01:29:22,829
and work out this alibi
until I'm satisfied with it.

1266
01:29:22,904 --> 01:29:24,132
You've reached the Kents.

1267
01:29:24,205 --> 01:29:26,070
Please leave your name
and number at the beep.

1268
01:29:26,141 --> 01:29:27,870
We'll get back to you
as soon as we can.

1269
01:29:27,942 --> 01:29:29,034
Have a good day.

1270
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:31,704
Bobby,
this is Marty Puccio.

1271
01:29:32,847 --> 01:29:34,508
I called you.

1272
01:29:34,582 --> 01:29:38,348
You asked me to call
when I got home, so I'm calling.

1273
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:39,444
Mr. Kent: Marty?

1274
01:29:59,074 --> 01:30:02,271
You think they could say
I was guilty of it?

1275
01:30:02,343 --> 01:30:03,742
I guess.

1276
01:30:06,381 --> 01:30:08,178
You stabbed him
in the heart.

1277
01:30:08,249 --> 01:30:11,150
When you were on top of him
and he was on his back.

1278
01:30:12,387 --> 01:30:15,515
No shit! I had that Mafia guy
with a baseball bat

1279
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:17,683
telling me
what to do every minute.

1280
01:30:17,759 --> 01:30:19,420
Yeah, that's true.

1281
01:30:20,762 --> 01:30:23,322
I guess they'd say
he did it.

1282
01:30:24,432 --> 01:30:27,833
No shit, Lisa! The guy bashed
his brains out with a ball bat.

1283
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:31,363
Lisa: Oh shit!

1284
01:30:32,874 --> 01:30:35,866
That was so gross!
(nervous laughter)

1285
01:30:35,944 --> 01:30:39,471
And the guy goes like...
and the shitjust...

1286
01:30:39,547 --> 01:30:41,208
That was so sick!

1287
01:30:46,488 --> 01:30:48,820
You don't think
I could get in trouble?

1288
01:30:50,258 --> 01:30:51,555
For what?

1289
01:30:53,862 --> 01:30:56,057
For being there,
like an accessory?

1290
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,901
They could say that you were
a witness, but that's about it.

1291
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:03,733
That's no big deal.

1292
01:31:08,943 --> 01:31:10,774
So,
how do you feel?

1293
01:31:12,046 --> 01:31:14,708
- If we don't get caught?
- Yeah.

1294
01:31:14,783 --> 01:31:19,584
Shit, babe! I feel like
a ton of bricks got lifted off me.

1295
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:23,750
We did it.

1296
01:31:26,961 --> 01:31:29,156
We killed a guy.

1297
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,733
(giggling)

1298
01:32:01,129 --> 01:32:03,256
Hey man, I heard.
You're off the chain!

1299
01:32:03,331 --> 01:32:04,992
- What?
- You're out of hand.

1300
01:32:05,066 --> 01:32:06,192
The fuck
you're talking about?

1301
01:32:06,267 --> 01:32:08,326
Fatalize, man.
Fatalize.

1302
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:15,268
I don't know, man.
I'm just so uptight.

1303
01:32:15,343 --> 01:32:17,834
I can't sleep or do shit...
It's like...

1304
01:32:19,013 --> 01:32:22,471
I'm worried they're gonna find
some shit that's gonna give us away.

1305
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:24,575
I'm gonna...
get caught.

1306
01:32:25,753 --> 01:32:28,517
I'm so fucked!
I just...

1307
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:29,921
I just can't stop
thinking about it.

1308
01:32:31,259 --> 01:32:32,954
You didn't kill
that dude, did you?

1309
01:32:33,027 --> 01:32:35,154
No! Hell no! I didn't have
shit to do with it.

1310
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:36,561
But I was there.

1311
01:32:36,631 --> 01:32:38,826
Someone could say
I was a witness.

1312
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:42,961
I don't know. Maybe if you just know
that something like this happened,

1313
01:32:43,037 --> 01:32:45,198
and you don't tell the cops,
they have some fuckin' law,

1314
01:32:45,273 --> 01:32:47,400
some fine print that
could get you in trouble.

1315
01:32:47,475 --> 01:32:52,344
Like leaving the scene
of an accident and not reporting it.

1316
01:32:52,413 --> 01:32:54,244
Yeah, they have that
in driver's ed.

1317
01:32:54,315 --> 01:32:57,216
I know.
So, shit!

1318
01:32:58,219 --> 01:33:00,483
It's like... I just...

1319
01:33:00,555 --> 01:33:01,817
I need an alibi, man.

1320
01:33:03,324 --> 01:33:05,724
I need someone to say
I was with him, so...

1321
01:33:05,793 --> 01:33:07,556
so, I could be like,

1322
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:09,927
"No... I wasn't anywhere near
those assholes that night.

1323
01:33:09,998 --> 01:33:11,659
I was nowhere near them."

1324
01:33:11,733 --> 01:33:13,496
Say this to who?

1325
01:33:13,568 --> 01:33:15,263
To the cops.

1326
01:33:17,005 --> 01:33:20,338
I need someone to say
I was with them.

1327
01:33:26,581 --> 01:33:29,573
What kind of asshole is gonna lie
to the cops about a murder?

1328
01:33:39,727 --> 01:33:41,524
Hey Lisa.
What's up?

1329
01:33:42,697 --> 01:33:45,530
You're not gonna believe this shit.
You're not gonna believe it.

1330
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,897
We killed Bobby.

1331
01:33:46,968 --> 01:33:48,162
Claudia: Pardon me?

1332
01:33:49,437 --> 01:33:51,132
We killed him, he's dead.
We did it.

1333
01:33:52,273 --> 01:33:55,606
You should've seen it.
Marty stuck him right in the heart.

1334
01:33:55,677 --> 01:33:57,645
Lisa, what are you
talking about?

1335
01:33:57,712 --> 01:34:00,738
No shit, listen.

1336
01:34:00,815 --> 01:34:02,942
You know that guy Donny?

1337
01:34:03,017 --> 01:34:04,917
You know, the loser?
You met him.

1338
01:34:07,522 --> 01:34:10,889
He stuck him right
in the back of the head.

1339
01:34:10,959 --> 01:34:12,824
Claudia: Lisa, what?

1340
01:34:13,928 --> 01:34:16,089
It's so weird.

1341
01:34:16,164 --> 01:34:19,224
This hitman, right?
He takes his baseball bat...

1342
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:21,564
and right when Bobby's
on the ground...

1343
01:34:22,603 --> 01:34:24,537
he's like gurgling
like a baby...

1344
01:34:24,605 --> 01:34:28,041
shooting blood and
his guts are hanging out...

1345
01:34:29,844 --> 01:34:31,038
and his eyes...

1346
01:34:32,113 --> 01:34:34,775
It was so sick, his eyes were
popping out of his head.

1347
01:34:34,849 --> 01:34:37,545
He takes his baseball bat
and he swings it,

1348
01:34:37,618 --> 01:34:39,677
and he half caves
in his head.

1349
01:34:39,754 --> 01:34:41,381
Claudia:
You watched this?

1350
01:34:41,456 --> 01:34:43,390
Yeah, I was there.
And Ali and Heather.

1351
01:34:44,525 --> 01:34:45,492
We were all there.

1352
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,790
And we saw it,
most of it.

1353
01:34:47,862 --> 01:34:49,830
Heather,
you met her, right?

1354
01:34:51,232 --> 01:34:53,223
She's so strange.

1355
01:34:53,301 --> 01:34:55,963
She gets that blank look,
like she's not even there.

1356
01:34:56,037 --> 01:34:59,131
And she starts hugging
her knees and rocking...

1357
01:34:59,207 --> 01:35:01,903
like she's totally fried.
And then, after...

1358
01:35:01,976 --> 01:35:04,467
she justs shrugs
and says "Fuck them."

1359
01:35:13,654 --> 01:35:15,554
- Lisa...
- Listen, Claudia.

1360
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:18,725
I'm really worried
about how we left him.

1361
01:35:18,793 --> 01:35:21,057
He's just out there,
where anyone can see him.

1362
01:35:21,129 --> 01:35:22,858
I can't stop thinking
about it, you know?

1363
01:35:24,732 --> 01:35:27,257
Like someone walking up
and finding him.

1364
01:35:28,436 --> 01:35:31,735
We should've hid him better,
pushed him in the canal more.

1365
01:35:31,806 --> 01:35:35,435
At least the gators would've got him
or he would have sunk, but...

1366
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:37,171
That's why I came over.

1367
01:35:37,245 --> 01:35:38,212
Claudia: What?

1368
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,010
Claudia,
I need to go out there.

1369
01:35:43,217 --> 01:35:45,378
Can you borrow your mother's car?
I need a ride.

1370
01:35:45,453 --> 01:35:47,045
I need someone
to help me move it.

1371
01:35:47,121 --> 01:35:49,316
- Claudia: It?
- The body.

1372
01:35:51,793 --> 01:35:55,729
- You murdered Bobby Kent?
- I didn't say I murdered anybody.

1373
01:35:55,797 --> 01:36:00,029
They killed him.
I won't even say they murdered him.

1374
01:36:00,101 --> 01:36:03,298
- He was fighting back.
- He was?

1375
01:36:03,371 --> 01:36:05,168
Yeah!
He was trying to get away.

1376
01:36:05,239 --> 01:36:07,707
Begging Marty.
You know,

1377
01:36:07,775 --> 01:36:12,735
saying, "I'm sorry, please.
I'll do anything, don't kill me."

1378
01:36:12,814 --> 01:36:14,543
Right when he said that,

1379
01:36:14,615 --> 01:36:16,708
Marty walked up to him

1380
01:36:16,784 --> 01:36:19,412
and whacked him in the heart
with his diving knife.

1381
01:36:19,487 --> 01:36:22,650
The whole thing
was just totally extreme!

1382
01:36:24,492 --> 01:36:26,016
Oh. Wait.

1383
01:36:26,094 --> 01:36:29,120
You want somebody to take you
out there to move a body?

1384
01:36:29,197 --> 01:36:32,633
I don't... anybody crazy
enough to do that...

1385
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:36,158
Fine, fine.
We won't go move it.

1386
01:36:36,237 --> 01:36:39,673
We'll just go out there see
if the tire tracks are gone.

1387
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:42,004
No way, Lisa.
No way.

1388
01:36:42,076 --> 01:36:44,306
- Come on!
- No!

1389
01:36:44,378 --> 01:36:47,006
Look, I gotta go.
I'm late for work.

1390
01:36:47,081 --> 01:36:49,140
I'm supposed to be
in Pizza Hut in half an hour.

1391
01:36:49,217 --> 01:36:52,983
Well, screw you, Claudia.
All I wanted was a ride...

1392
01:36:54,155 --> 01:36:57,647
I hope you have a problem someday,
so you can ask me for help.

1393
01:36:57,725 --> 01:36:58,749
Shit!

1394
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:02,791
You don't have to make
a federal case out of it.

1395
01:37:02,864 --> 01:37:04,525
I just asked
for a fuckin' ride.

1396
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:07,964
Lisa: Claudia, keep
your fuckin' mouth shut.

1397
01:37:15,376 --> 01:37:17,310
Claudia's mom:
Was that Lisa leaving?

1398
01:37:17,378 --> 01:37:18,538
Yeah.

1399
01:37:18,613 --> 01:37:21,013
- Is everything okay?
- Claudia: Yeah!

1400
01:37:21,082 --> 01:37:24,279
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1401
01:37:24,352 --> 01:37:26,616
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

1402
01:37:26,687 --> 01:37:28,621
I gotta go to work, Mom.

1403
01:37:32,226 --> 01:37:35,593
Mom, what if you witnessed
a crime, like a murder,

1404
01:37:35,663 --> 01:37:39,099
and you called the hotline
but didn't give your name.

1405
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:40,691
Would that be legal?

1406
01:37:40,768 --> 01:37:42,531
I don't know
what you mean, Ali.

1407
01:37:42,603 --> 01:37:44,935
What kind of a crime?

1408
01:37:45,006 --> 01:37:46,405
A murder,
I told you.

1409
01:37:48,009 --> 01:37:50,239
What are you kids
up to, Ali?

1410
01:37:50,311 --> 01:37:52,279
I was just asking,
for Christ's sakes.

1411
01:37:52,346 --> 01:37:54,337
I mean,
would it still count?

1412
01:37:54,415 --> 01:37:56,144
You could still say
you reported it, right?

1413
01:37:57,852 --> 01:38:01,015
If you saw a murder,
and just called the hotline,

1414
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:03,556
and reported it and didn't give
your name or anything,

1415
01:38:03,624 --> 01:38:06,684
- would that be enough?
- Would it?

1416
01:38:06,761 --> 01:38:10,993
I don't know the law, but...
I don't think so.

1417
01:38:11,065 --> 01:38:13,533
I think you would still
have to say who you were.

1418
01:38:13,601 --> 01:38:16,126
- But why wouldn't it...
- Why are you asking these questions?

1419
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:19,731
Why wouldn't it count?
You could still say you reported it.

1420
01:38:21,008 --> 01:38:23,442
Ali, are you talking about
a "murder" murder?

1421
01:38:24,512 --> 01:38:27,504
I guess.
This guy kind of got killed.

1422
01:38:27,582 --> 01:38:30,050
Why would you
just call a hotline?

1423
01:38:30,117 --> 01:38:32,677
I was just asking, God!

1424
01:38:32,753 --> 01:38:35,244
(phone ringing)

1425
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:40,457
(ringing continues)

1426
01:38:48,436 --> 01:38:49,664
Hello?

1427
01:38:49,737 --> 01:38:51,466
Marty,
where have you been?

1428
01:38:51,539 --> 01:38:53,632
Somebody made an anonymous
call to the cops.

1429
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:55,232
Lisa:
They know about Bobby.

1430
01:38:55,309 --> 01:38:57,971
- Have they found him?
- I don't know.

1431
01:38:58,045 --> 01:38:59,876
Somebody told them
he got murdered.

1432
01:38:59,947 --> 01:39:02,177
- Murdered?
- That's what they said.

1433
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:04,741
- They used that word?
- Yes!

1434
01:39:06,287 --> 01:39:08,221
Did you fuckin'
talk to somebody?

1435
01:39:08,289 --> 01:39:11,258
No, I didn't talk
to anybody, Jesus!

1436
01:40:34,175 --> 01:40:36,575
(coughing)

1437
01:40:46,787 --> 01:40:50,484
- You're up early.
- I'm going to the skate park.

1438
01:40:51,726 --> 01:40:53,751
What did you do
with the earring?

1439
01:40:53,828 --> 01:40:55,318
It fell out.

1440
01:41:24,492 --> 01:41:25,959
I love you, buddy.

1441
01:41:27,094 --> 01:41:28,493
Yeah,
I love you too.

1442
01:41:38,973 --> 01:41:40,565
Who the fuck
did you tell, Lisa?

1443
01:41:40,641 --> 01:41:43,109
It wasn't me, bitch.
For all I know, it's you.

1444
01:41:43,177 --> 01:41:45,111
The cops are onto us,
we have to come up there.

1445
01:41:45,179 --> 01:41:46,612
Not with police on you,
you don't.

1446
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:48,545
You gotta hide us.

1447
01:41:49,683 --> 01:41:52,550
They know how Bobby
died and everything.

1448
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:54,315
We're all
in this together, right?

1449
01:42:05,533 --> 01:42:08,366
- Alice, geez!
- Ali: It's okay!

1450
01:42:08,436 --> 01:42:11,064
It's all right.
I've got it under control.

1451
01:42:11,138 --> 01:42:13,106
I don't want them
to know where I sleep.

1452
01:42:13,174 --> 01:42:16,871
- This is going to stop, right now.
- Move me in my own apartment then.

1453
01:42:16,944 --> 01:42:19,504
- An apartment?
- Godfucking damn it!

1454
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:22,845
We need to hide because they're
gonna come to your house.

1455
01:42:22,917 --> 01:42:25,044
Baby, who are they?

1456
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:28,350
Alice seems to think that
some of her friends killed somebody.

1457
01:42:29,457 --> 01:42:31,857
Who in the hell,
Virginia?

1458
01:42:31,926 --> 01:42:34,486
- That is something for the police.
- Ali: No police, because

1459
01:42:34,562 --> 01:42:36,393
a Mafia hitman did this.

1460
01:42:36,464 --> 01:42:39,194
He said that if we told
anybody, he'd kill us.

1461
01:42:39,266 --> 01:42:41,928
Is this about getting
your own apartment?

1462
01:42:42,002 --> 01:42:45,438
- No! I don't want an apartment!
- Hey! Honey, hey.

1463
01:42:45,506 --> 01:42:46,973
Fuck.

1464
01:42:47,041 --> 01:42:48,235
- Don't touch me!
- Baby...

1465
01:42:48,309 --> 01:42:49,970
- Baby!
- Don't touch me!

1466
01:42:50,044 --> 01:42:52,535
- (Ali screaming)
- Ali, chill!

1467
01:42:53,848 --> 01:42:56,112
- That's it.
- He's not in the Mafia.

1468
01:42:56,183 --> 01:42:57,775
Lisa: You don't know
what you're talking about.

1469
01:42:57,852 --> 01:43:00,047
- He must be protecting you.
- Protecting me?

1470
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:02,384
I'm his brother.
That lazy fucker protects dick.

1471
01:43:02,456 --> 01:43:04,321
He doesn't have a job.

1472
01:43:04,391 --> 01:43:06,291
What about
the Crazy Motherfuckers?

1473
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,385
He wanted to be in Davy Boyz
but chickened out.

1474
01:43:08,462 --> 01:43:09,986
Got the tattoo instead.

1475
01:43:10,064 --> 01:43:11,929
You ought
to turn yourselves in.

1476
01:43:14,802 --> 01:43:17,396
But if I turn my self in,
I may go tojail.

1477
01:43:17,471 --> 01:43:19,701
She's afraid
they'll put her in jail.

1478
01:43:19,773 --> 01:43:23,209
- Tell her you'll write to her.
- Hey man, I'll write to you.

1479
01:43:26,847 --> 01:43:28,439
(dial tone)

1480
01:43:44,064 --> 01:43:47,556
- TV host: Good toss, Laura...
- (pounding on the door)

1481
01:43:52,473 --> 01:43:54,373
Sheriff's office!
Where is Marty?

1482
01:43:54,441 --> 01:43:56,432
Where is he?
Let's go!

1483
01:44:02,483 --> 01:44:04,280
Sheriff's office,
don't move.

1484
01:44:04,351 --> 01:44:06,512
- Where's Marty?
- Mother: In the bedroom.

1485
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,421
- Sheriff's office!
- What's going on?

1486
01:44:14,495 --> 01:44:16,986
Does the name
Bobby Kent ring a bell?

1487
01:44:20,167 --> 01:44:22,260
(indistinct chatter)

1488
01:44:26,807 --> 01:44:27,796
Officer: Hurry.

1489
01:45:04,345 --> 01:45:06,905
(indistinct crowd chatter)

1490
01:45:18,359 --> 01:45:22,295
I'm due in seven weeks. If it's a boy,
I'll name him Marty.

1491
01:45:24,231 --> 01:45:26,131
Will you send me
a picture?

1492
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:27,224
Yeah.

1493
01:45:27,301 --> 01:45:29,895
Are they gonna
let you out to have it?

1494
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:31,961
Shut up, bitch.
You're a fuckin' snitch.

1495
01:45:32,039 --> 01:45:33,768
You cut a deal.
We all know that.

1496
01:45:34,842 --> 01:45:35,934
Is it true?

1497
01:45:37,044 --> 01:45:39,808
Marty: Shit, Ali.
You don't know that yet?

1498
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,348
Jesus,
who is your lawyer?

1499
01:45:42,416 --> 01:45:45,908
Marty: Her and Dumbo here have been
snitching on us to save their asses,

1500
01:45:45,986 --> 01:45:47,817
otherwise
we wouldn't be here today.

1501
01:45:47,888 --> 01:45:51,221
Psst! Sorry ass snitch
motherfucker!

1502
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:52,690
I know
what you're doing.

1503
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:55,786
- You're gonna regret this.
- Lisa: Leave him alone, asshole!

1504
01:45:55,863 --> 01:45:57,387
You've done enough
to ruin his life.

1505
01:45:57,464 --> 01:45:58,897
Shut the fuck up!

1506
01:45:58,966 --> 01:46:02,231
- Your fat cousin ruined it.
- I don't know what I'm doing here.

1507
01:46:02,302 --> 01:46:04,463
I didn't do shit.
I don't know why I'm here.

1508
01:46:04,538 --> 01:46:05,505
You stabbed him, dude.

1509
01:46:06,573 --> 01:46:07,562
What are
you crying about?

1510
01:46:07,641 --> 01:46:09,074
- Shut the...
- You shut the fuck up!

1511
01:46:11,645 --> 01:46:13,806
Under the big
bright yellow sun

1512
01:46:13,881 --> 01:46:16,543
Under the big
bright yellow sun

1513
01:46:16,617 --> 01:46:19,450
Under the big
bright yellow sun

1514
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,351
Under the big
bright yellow sun

1515
01:46:21,422 --> 01:46:23,652
Under the big
bright yellow sun

1516
01:46:23,724 --> 01:46:26,056
Under the big
bright yellow sun.

1517
01:48:55,242 --> 01:48:57,472
(trip hop music playing)

1518
01:49:02,416 --> 01:49:04,247
This recording
is 38 and sinkin'

1519
01:49:04,318 --> 01:49:06,582
Funkier than Pepe le Pew
so I was thinking

1520
01:49:06,653 --> 01:49:08,621
About dropping this single
on the charts

1521
01:49:08,689 --> 01:49:10,316
Letting you know,
"Hey, the kid has heart"

1522
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:12,620
I never deny myself
as being dope

1523
01:49:12,693 --> 01:49:14,388
But in my lastjam,
niggas slept in my notes

1524
01:49:14,461 --> 01:49:16,292
You thought I was weak?
Let me speak

1525
01:49:16,363 --> 01:49:18,923
My rhymes come funkier
than your grandfather's feet

1526
01:49:18,999 --> 01:49:20,489
So listen, Mister,
don't you ever forget

1527
01:49:20,567 --> 01:49:22,501
The rhyme is dirty, you couldn't
even clean it with Comet

1528
01:49:22,569 --> 01:49:24,662
Or even Borax
some try Ajax

1529
01:49:24,738 --> 01:49:27,138
Only mix with
the best 48 tracks

1530
01:49:27,207 --> 01:49:28,765
I get down
with the ace all sounds

1531
01:49:28,842 --> 01:49:30,742
Lyrics that be coming
from miles around

1532
01:49:30,811 --> 01:49:32,711
So let the music
shut your ass up

1533
01:49:32,779 --> 01:49:34,974
And pull the uppercut
that will make you fall...

1534
01:49:35,048 --> 01:49:36,379
M-M-Master

1535
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:38,884
Break it on down

1536
01:49:38,952 --> 01:49:40,886
Fall on your butt,
your ass won't hurt

1537
01:49:40,954 --> 01:49:42,683
They call us ringworm
'cause we master the skirt

1538
01:49:42,756 --> 01:49:44,986
I act like a jerk but
I'm out for the dough

1539
01:49:45,058 --> 01:49:47,026
Fool master the funk
master the ho's

1540
01:49:47,094 --> 01:49:48,959
Only master
plays the fool

1541
01:49:49,029 --> 01:49:51,054
I work hard
and pay my dues

1542
01:49:51,131 --> 01:49:52,996
Tony Snatch
here plays the fool

1543
01:49:53,066 --> 01:49:55,500
That runs with it, eat it
and give you the bone

1544
01:49:55,569 --> 01:49:56,934
I'm in the club
with No Wa Di

1545
01:49:57,004 --> 01:49:59,438
They're gonna have to close
the club up messing with me

1546
01:49:59,506 --> 01:50:01,133
Dirty and stinky stuff

1547
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:03,403
We some dirty du luh
with some stinkin' nuts

1548
01:50:03,477 --> 01:50:05,206
Last call,
now drink it up

1549
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:07,270
Me and Dirt on the prowl
for some stinky sluts

1550
01:50:07,347 --> 01:50:08,177
Last call for alcohol

1551
01:50:08,248 --> 01:50:11,877
Everybody out the door,
get your back up off the wall

1552
01:50:14,488 --> 01:50:16,353
Last call for alcohol

1553
01:50:16,423 --> 01:50:19,824
Everybody out the door,
get your back up off the wall.

1554
01:50:37,477 --> 01:50:40,241
You're gonna
visit your car

1555
01:50:44,217 --> 01:50:47,277
It's one of my peeps

1556
01:50:47,354 --> 01:50:50,721
With a blow
to your head

1557
01:50:50,791 --> 01:50:54,249
Is that
what you're needed?

1558
01:50:54,328 --> 01:50:57,559
You're probably bleeding

1559
01:50:57,631 --> 01:51:00,657
Is that what you needed?

1560
01:51:00,734 --> 01:51:04,932
You're probably bleeding

1561
01:51:05,005 --> 01:51:07,371
Just like a movie

1562
01:51:08,442 --> 01:51:10,637
Just like a movie

1563
01:51:11,878 --> 01:51:14,438
Just like a movie

1564
01:51:15,549 --> 01:51:17,244
Life doesn't move me

1565
01:51:17,317 --> 01:51:19,877
Life doesn't move me

1566
01:51:21,788 --> 01:51:23,722
I keep with you now

1567
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:25,781
Here in your car

1568
01:51:25,859 --> 01:51:27,349
Left the bar

1569
01:51:27,427 --> 01:51:28,985
Playing the Big Part

1570
01:51:29,062 --> 01:51:30,689
Keep complaining

1571
01:51:30,764 --> 01:51:33,289
It's probably raining

1572
01:51:35,902 --> 01:51:37,426
It's one of my peeps

1573
01:51:37,504 --> 01:51:39,233
With a blow to your head

1574
01:51:39,306 --> 01:51:40,967
Is that what you needed?

1575
01:51:41,041 --> 01:51:42,941
What you needed

1576
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:45,035
What you needed

1577
01:51:54,955 --> 01:51:56,650
It doesn't move me

1578
01:51:56,723 --> 01:51:58,122
It's like a movie

1579
01:51:58,191 --> 01:52:00,091
Just like a movie

1580
01:52:02,129 --> 01:52:04,097
It doesn't move me

1581
01:52:05,899 --> 01:52:07,696
Move me

1582
01:52:10,237 --> 01:52:12,262
Just like a movie

1583
01:52:15,575 --> 01:52:17,372
It doesn't move me

1584
01:52:17,444 --> 01:52:19,571
It's like a movie.
