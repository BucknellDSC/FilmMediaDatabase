the Japanese codes...

and built the A-bomb.

Mathematicians...

00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,026
The stated goal of the Soviets

To triumph,

publishable,

11
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:04,578

The next Einstein?

Welcome to Princeton,
gentlemen.

00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:40,617
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

19
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:43,848
No, he has to have it
all for himself.

20
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:45,479
It's the first time
the Carnegie Prize...

21
00:02:45,523 --> 00:02:47,548

Hansen's all bent.

22

[Man #2]
Rumor is he's got his sights
set on Wheeler Lab,

They're only taking
one this year.

Hansen's used
to being picked first.

26
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,859
Oh, yeah,
he's wasted on math.

27
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,767
He should be running
for president.

28
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:11,747
There could be
a mathematical explanation...

29
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:14,410
for how bad your tie is.

Neils here broke
a Jap code.

34

Helped rid the world
of fascism.

35
00:03:27,398 --> 00:03:30,697
At least that's what
he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?

36
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,635
The name's Bender.
Atomic physics.

Yes.
Yes, Mr. Sol.

00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,873
Oh, good.
Uh, hi.

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,981
Ah, Bender.
Nice to see you.

00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,510
Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
Ah, thank you.

45
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:53,022
I'll take another.

Excuse me?

47
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:56,725
A thousand pardons.
I simply assumed you
were the waiter.

48
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:59,559
Play nice, Hansen.
Nice is not Hansen's
strong suit.

49
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,462
[Hansen]
Honest mistake.

50
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,023
Well, Martin Hansen.

51
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:08,003
It is Martin, isn't it?
Why, yes, John, it is.

52
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,372
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

53
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:16,711

The one on Nazi ciphers,

56
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:23,316
and the other one
on nonlinear equations,

57
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:25,254
and I am
supremely confident...

58
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:26,722
that there is not
a single seminal...

59
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,486

is not having enough water

what happens to you...

when you're dying
of thirst.

78
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:48,538
So, dying
of thirst...

79
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:51,837
would probably feel...

80
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,503
pretty much like
the hangover...

00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:26,281
under security review
by the D.O.D.

182
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,545
Derivative drivel.

183
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:31,418
But Nash achievements:

184
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:32,785
Zero.

185
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:35,690
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual
question coming?

186
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,196
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

187
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,255
Huh?

188
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,767
How will it feel
when I'm chosen
for Wheeler...

189
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:47,998
and you're not?

190
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,707
What if you lose?

191
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:58,613
[Bender]
Ah, there it is.

192
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:00,081
[Chuckles]

193
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,887
You should not have won.

194
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,388
Hmmm.

195
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,051
I had the first move,
my-my play was perfect.

196
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,616
The hubris
of the defeated.

197
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:12,924
The game is flawed.

198
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,938
Gentlemen,
the great John Nash.

199
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:31,604
[Charles]
You've been in here
for two days.

200
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:36,514
You know Hansen's
just published another paper?

201
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:38,782
I can't even find a topic
for my doctorate.

202
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,983
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

203
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,890
This is a group
playing touch football.

204
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:52,333
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs.

205
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,963
And this here is a woman
who is chasing a man
who stole her purse.

206
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,173
John, you watched
a mugging.

207
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:02,678
That's weird.

208
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:05,442
In competitive behavior
someone always loses.

209
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,213
Well, my niece knows that,
John, and she's about this high.

210
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:12,619
See, if I could derive
an equilibrium...

211
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:15,249
where prevalence is
a non-singular event,

212
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:17,691
where nobody loses,

213
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,752
can you imagine the effect
that would have...

214
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,766
on conflict scenarios,
and arms negotiations...
When did you last eat?

215
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:26,302
When did you last eat?
...currency exchange?

216
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,133
You know, food.

217
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,202
You have no respect
for cognitive reverie,
you know that?

218
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:35,302
Yes. But pizza...

219
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,308
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

220
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,477
And of course beer.

221
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:50,551
I have respect for beer.

222
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:54,386
I have respect for beer!

223
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:04,171
[Bender]
Good evening, Neils.
[Hansen] Hey, Nash.

224
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,175
Who's winning? You or you?

225
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,939
[Bender] Evening, Nash.
[Sol] Hey, guys.

226
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:10,912
Hey, Nash.

227
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:13,711
[Woman]
He's looking
at you for sure.

228
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:20,081
Hey, Nash.

229
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:21,749
Neils is trying
to get your attention.

230
00:13:21,825 --> 00:13:24,157
[Bender] You'rejoking.
[Sol] Oh, no.

231
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,892
Go with God.
Come back a man.

232
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:36,033
Fortune favors the brave.
Bombs away.

233
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:42,142
Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success...

234
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,180
dramatically improve
with each attempt.

235
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:55,848
This is going
to be classic.

236
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:28,455
Maybe you want
to buy me a drink.

237
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,664
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say...

238
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,462
in order for you
to have intercourse with me,

239
00:14:38,235 --> 00:14:41,204
but could we assume
that I said all that?

240
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:44,172
Essentially we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

241
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:46,141
So, could we just
go straight to the sex?

242
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,142
Oh, that was sweet.

243
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,174
Have a nice night,
asshole!

244
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,411
[Man Laughs]
[Neilson] Ladies, wait!

245
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,249
[Charles] I...

246
00:14:58,288 --> 00:15:00,483
I especially liked
the bit about fluid exchange.

247
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,687
It was really charming.

248
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,495
[Professor]
Walk with me, John.

249
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,797
I've been meaning
to talk with you.

250
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:15,804
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

251
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:18,363
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

252
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:20,501
Wheeler, sir.
That would be
my first choice.

253
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,034
And actually,
I don't really have
a second choice, sir.

254
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:25,275
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

255
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:27,313
They've written papers.
They've published.

256
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,179
I'm still searching, sir,
for my...

257
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,983
Your original idea, I know.
Governing dynamics, sir.

258
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:33,717
It's very clever, John,
but I'm afraid...

259
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:36,157
it's just not nearly
good enough.

260
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:44,130
May I?
Thank you.

261
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:46,897
I've been working
on manifold embedding.

262
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:49,064
My bargaining stratagems
are starting to show
some promise.

263
00:15:49,106 --> 00:15:50,767
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

264
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:52,900
if you'd be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein...

265
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:54,934
I've repeatedly asked
you for that.
Now, John.

266
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:57,503
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...
John? John.

267
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,142
Do you see what they're
doing in there?

268
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:03,880
[Professor] Congratulations.
[Max] Thank you so much.

269
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:07,814
Congratulations,
Professor Max.

270
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:10,291
[Max] Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

271
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:12,762
It's the pens.

272
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:15,093
Reserved for a member
of the department...

273
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:17,065
that makes the achievement
of a lifetime.

274
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:19,799
Now, what do you see, John?

275
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:22,603
Recognition.

276
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:25,437
Well done, Professor.
Well done.

277
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:27,943
Well, try seeing
accomplishment.

278
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:29,808
Is there a difference?

279
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,177
John,

280
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:34,513
you haven't focused.

281
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:37,678
I'm sorry,
but up to this point,

282
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:40,450
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

283
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:45,488
Good day.

284
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:57,866
And my compliments
to you, sir.

285
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you so much.

286
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,628
I can't see it.

287
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,663
[Whimpers]

288
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:28,603
- Aah!
- Jesus Christ, John.

289
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,072
I can't fail.

290
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:34,042
This is all I am.
Come on, let's go out.

291
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:36,102
I got to get
something done.
John!

292
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,012
- I can't keep
staring into space.
- John, enough!

293
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:41,607
Got to face the wall,
follow their rules,
read their books,

294
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,175
You want to do
some damage? Fine...

295
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:45,346
But don't mess around.
Do their classes.

296
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:47,515
Come on!
Go on, bust your head!

297
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:49,252
Kill yourself.

298
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:51,692
Don't do it.
Don't mess around.

299
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:53,525
Bust your head!
Go on,

300
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:55,531
bust that worthless head
wide open.

301
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,692
Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?!

302
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:03,732
It's not my problem.

303
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:07,037
And it's not your problem.

304
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,380
It's their problem.

305
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:15,543
Your answer isn't
face the wall.

306
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:17,951
It's out there...

307
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:19,648
where you've been working.

308
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:37,237
[Panting]
[Gasps]

309
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:43,369
That was heavy.

310
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:49,113
That Isaac Newton fellow
was right.

311
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:50,983
He was onto something.
Clever boy.

312
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:52,282
[Giggles]

313
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:56,314
[John]
Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.

314
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:58,759
[Both Laughing]
Oh, God.

315
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,431
[Neilson]
Incoming, gentlemen.
[Sol] Ay-yi-yi.

316
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:09,136
[Sighs]
Deep breaths.

317
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,964
[Sol]
Nash, you might
want to stop...

318
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:15,273
shuffling your papers
for five seconds.

319
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:20,573
I will not buy
you gentlemen beer.

320
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,210
[Bender]
Oh, we're not here
for beer, my friend.

321
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,187
[John] Oh.
[Sol Chuckles]

322
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,052
Does anyone else feel
she should be moving
in slow motion?

323
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:33,755
Will she want
a large wedding, ya think?

324
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,297
Shall we say swords,
gentlemen?

325
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:38,334
Pistols at dawn?
Have you remembered nothing?

326
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:40,733
Recall the lessons
of Adam Smith,

327
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,738
the father
of modern economics.

328
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,637
"In competition...

329
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,404
[Sol and Neilson]
Individual ambition
serves the common good."

330
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,775
- Exactly.
- Every man for himself, gentlemen.

331
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:52,838
[Bender]
And those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

332
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,781
[Hansen]
I'm not gonna strike out.

333
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:57,319
[Sol]
You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

334
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:59,412
- I don't think he said that.
- [Sol] Nobody move...

335
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,514
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

336
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:04,287
[Hansen]
Oh, God. He may have
the upper hand now,

337
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:06,522
but wait until he
opens his mouth.

338
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,723
[Laughing]
Remember the last time?

339
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:11,028
[Bender]
Oh, yes, that was one
for the history books.

340
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:20,873
- Adam Smith needs revision.
- What are you talking about?

341
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:23,606
If we all go for the blonde,

342
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,678
we block each other.

343
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:34,053
Not a single one of us
is gonna get her.

344
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:36,786
So then we go
for her friends,

345
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:39,626
but they will all
give us the cold shoulder...

346
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,256
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

347
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:45,267
Well, what if no one goes
for the blonde?

348
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,100
We don't get
in each other's way,

349
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:52,107
and we don't insult
the other girls.

350
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:55,473

00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,181
It's not that simple,
you know?

527
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:20,916
Well, you ended
the war.

528
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,585
We incinerated 150,000 people
in a heartbeat.

529
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,527
Great deeds come
at great cost, Mr. Parcher.

530
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:31,260
Well, conviction,
it turns out,

531
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:34,599
is a luxury of those
on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

532
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:38,398
I'll try
and keep that in mind.

533
00:33:41,243 --> 00:33:44,440
So, John, no family,

534
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:46,344
no close friends...

535
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:47,939
Why is that?

536
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:49,985
I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

537
00:33:50,553 --> 00:33:54,284
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

where your lack
of personal connection...

541
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:01,254
would be considered
an advantage.

542
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:06,466
This is a secure area.
They know me.

543
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:10,729
Have you ever
been here?

544
00:34:10,806 --> 00:34:12,637
We were told during
our initial briefing...

545
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,676
that these warehouses
were abandoned.

546
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:16,905
That's not
precisely accurate.

[Sirens, Man Speaking Russian]

550
00:34:53,816 --> 00:34:55,841
By telling you
what I'm about to tell you,

551
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,613
I am increasing
your security clearance...

552
00:34:57,686 --> 00:34:59,347
to top secret.

553
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:03,051
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

554
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,456
Get it?

555
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:06,518
What operation?

556
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:14,160
Those are a good idea.

557
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,637
This factory is in Berlin.
We seized it
at the end of the war.

558
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,439
Nazi engineers
were attempting...

559
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:26,106
to build a portable
atomic bomb.

560
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:28,810
The Soviets reached
this facility before we did,

561
00:35:28,884 --> 00:35:30,545
and we lost the damn thing.

562
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:34,982
The routing orders
at the Pentagon,

563
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:37,252
they were about this,
weren't they?

564
00:35:37,326 --> 00:35:41,126
The Soviets aren't
as unified as people believe.

565
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:44,792
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svobga,

566
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:47,233
"the New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb...

567
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:49,897
and intends to detonate it
on U.S. Soil.

568
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,873
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

[Parcher]
Man is capable of as much atrocity
as he has imagination.

570

New Freedom has sleeper agents
here in the U.S.

571
00:36:08,724 --> 00:36:10,658
McCarthy is an idiot,

572
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:12,785
but unfortunately
that doesn't make him wrong.

573
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:16,764
New Freedom communicates
to its agents...

574
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:19,665
through codes imbedded
in newspapers and magazines,

575
00:36:19,735 --> 00:36:21,327
and that's
where you come in.

576
00:36:21,403 --> 00:36:25,669
You see, John,
what distinguishes you...

577
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:27,504
is that you are,

578
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,168

What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

581
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:49,621
Commit this list
of periodicals to memory.

582
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:54,794
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes,

583
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,531

The isotope decays
predictably.

As a result,
these numbers change over time.

They're the access codes
to your drop spot.

Boy, you must be
really important.

It's all right, Mike.

working on?

Oh. I suspect that...

The problem that you left
on the board...

607
00:38:39,308 --> 00:38:41,435
I solved it.

608
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,810
Oh, no you didn't.
You didn't even look.

609
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:49,908
I never said
that the vector fields
were rational functions.

Your solution is elegant.

Though on this
particular occasion,

612
00:39:02,197 --> 00:39:04,222

00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,899
if I can ask you to dinner.

00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,106

00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,608
Oh, on occasion, yeah.

00:39:55,884 --> 00:39:57,977
No, I expect
that you wouldn't...

623
00:39:58,053 --> 00:39:59,748
you wouldn't know, uh...

624
00:40:02,091 --> 00:40:04,787
If you leave your address
with my office,

625
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,954
I'll pick you up
Friday at 8:00...

626
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,555
and we'll eat.

627
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:20,240
One more thing.
Do you have a name,

628
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:22,800
or should I just
keep calling you "Miss"?

630
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,539
may I present...

How do you do?

632
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,510
Professor, please.
You and the governor.

633
00:40:34,857 --> 00:40:37,348
Wait, one second.
I'm sorry.

634
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:40,428

you find yourselves in...

638
00:40:49,204 --> 00:40:52,367
altogether naturally.

Why else would we
have so many colors?

644
00:41:28,544 --> 00:41:31,342
So you're a painter?

645
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:34,143
That's not actually
what I said,

646
00:41:34,216 --> 00:41:36,980
but, yes...

647
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:39,179
I am.

649
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:51,798
Me.

650
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:53,391
Your date?

651
00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:58,129
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

652
00:41:58,207 --> 00:42:00,300
That's a plan.

653
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:06,540
Champagne would be lovely.

654
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,884
I'll be outside.

655
00:42:09,952 --> 00:42:12,045
I will get the champagne.

656
00:42:20,662 --> 00:42:22,323
Oh, thank you.

657
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,066
Thank you for that.

658
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:27,499
No, keep it.

659
00:42:27,569 --> 00:42:30,800
I believe in deciding things
will be good luck.

660
00:42:30,873 --> 00:42:32,704

00:42:32,774 --> 00:42:34,708
No.

00:42:34,776 --> 00:42:36,744
I don't believe in luck.

663
00:42:41,116 --> 00:42:43,676
But I do believe
in assigning value to things.

664
00:42:44,686 --> 00:42:46,517
Oh.

665
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:56,453
I once tried
to count them all.

666
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,263
I actually made it
to 4,348.

667
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:06,733
You are exceptionally odd.

668
00:43:06,808 --> 00:43:09,675
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

669
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:17,451
A pair of odd ducks, then.

670
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,113

672
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,756

673
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,061
Pick a shape.
An animal...
anything.

674
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,098
Okay.

675
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:38,696
An umbrella.

00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,610
Do it again.

You don't talk much, do you?

683
00:47:16,758 --> 00:47:19,522
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

684
00:47:19,594 --> 00:47:21,425
I don't mean work.

685
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:29,002
I find that polishing
my interactions...

686
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:32,062
in order to make
them sociable requires
a tremendous effort.

687
00:47:33,742 --> 00:47:36,302
I have
a tendency to expedite
information flow...

688
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,979
by being direct.

689
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,478
I often don't get
a pleasant result.

690
00:47:44,553 --> 00:47:45,815
Try me.

691
00:47:47,822 --> 00:47:49,551
All right.

692
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,193
I find you attractive.

693
00:47:56,431 --> 00:47:58,399
Your aggressive
moves towards me...

694
00:47:58,466 --> 00:48:00,263
indicate that you
feel the same way.

695
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:03,133
But still,
ritual requires that we...

696
00:48:03,205 --> 00:48:05,935
continue with a number
of platonic activities...

697
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:08,271
before we have sex.

698
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:11,574
I am proceeding
with those activities,

699
00:48:11,646 --> 00:48:13,637
but in point
of actual fact,

700
00:48:13,715 --> 00:48:17,811
all I really want to do
is have intercourse with you
as soon as possible.

701
00:48:19,988 --> 00:48:22,115
Are you gonna
slap me now?

702
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,808
How was that result?

703
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,758
[Girl]
What are you doing?

704
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:14,865
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned reoccurrences...

705
00:49:14,943 --> 00:49:17,605
within periodicals
over time. And you?

706
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:19,874
You talk funny,
Mr. Nash.

707
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,053
Do I know you?

708
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:28,453
My uncle says
you're very smart...

709
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:30,218
but not very nice,

710
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:32,385
so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

711
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,485
And who might
your uncle be?

712
00:49:34,562 --> 00:49:36,996
The prodigal roommate...

713
00:49:37,065 --> 00:49:38,965
returns.

714
00:49:39,034 --> 00:49:40,695
[Chuckles]

715
00:49:42,404 --> 00:49:45,134
Come here.
Charles, Charles, Charles.

716
00:49:50,412 --> 00:49:52,505
My sister...

717
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,912
got herself killed
in a car crash.

718
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,577
Not too far now,
Marcee!

719
00:49:58,953 --> 00:50:00,716
Her cowboy husband
was too drunk...

720
00:50:00,755 --> 00:50:03,246
to know that he was
too drunk to drive.

721
00:50:03,325 --> 00:50:05,759
So, I took her in.

722
00:50:06,661 --> 00:50:10,427
She's so small.
She's young, John.
That's how they come.

723
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,591
I'm at Harvard...

724
00:50:14,669 --> 00:50:17,365
doing the great
author's workshop.

725
00:50:17,439 --> 00:50:19,498
D.H. Bloody Lawrence.

726
00:50:19,574 --> 00:50:21,701
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

727
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:23,835
[Chuckles]

728
00:50:23,912 --> 00:50:26,972
Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

729
00:50:27,982 --> 00:50:30,212
How are you, John?

730
00:50:30,285 --> 00:50:33,345
At first all my work
here was trivial,

731
00:50:33,421 --> 00:50:36,083
but a new assignment
came up and...

732
00:50:36,157 --> 00:50:39,183
I can't really tell you
any details.

733
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,558
Top secret?
Black bag? Black ops?

734
00:50:41,629 --> 00:50:43,790
Something like that.

735
00:50:43,865 --> 00:50:47,562
And, uh...
Yes?

736
00:50:47,635 --> 00:50:49,569
Well, I... I met a girl.

737
00:50:49,637 --> 00:50:52,572
No! A human girl?
Homo sapien.

738
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,801
A biped?
Yup. And contrary
to all probabilities,

739
00:50:54,876 --> 00:50:56,844
she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels.

740
00:50:56,878 --> 00:50:58,243
[Laughs]
Really?

741
00:50:58,313 --> 00:51:01,544
God, that's wonderful.

742
00:51:01,616 --> 00:51:04,449
There's no accounting
for taste, is there?

743
00:51:06,488 --> 00:51:08,581
Should I marry her?

744
00:51:08,656 --> 00:51:10,624
Oh, God. Right.

745
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,956
I mean, everything's
going well.

746
00:51:13,027 --> 00:51:15,621
The job is fine.
I have enough money.

747
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,392
It all seems to add up.

748
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:20,366
But how do you know
for sure?

749
00:51:22,303 --> 00:51:25,739
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

750
00:51:25,807 --> 00:51:27,866
That's the only
sure thing I do know.

751
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,874
[Waiter]
Good evening.

752
00:51:43,158 --> 00:51:45,626
Alicia, please don't
be angry.

753
00:51:45,693 --> 00:51:47,217
I just lost track
of time at work...

754
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:50,422
again.
Mm-hmm.

755
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:52,932
I'm sorry.

756
00:51:54,102 --> 00:51:55,967
I didn't have time
to wrap it.

757
00:51:56,037 --> 00:51:58,528
Happy birthday.

758
00:52:02,844 --> 00:52:04,869
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

759
00:52:04,946 --> 00:52:06,777
they create
a full wavelength dispersal,

760
00:52:06,848 --> 00:52:08,839
so if you look inside it,
you can see...

761
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,545
- Every possible color.
- Every possible color.

762
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:13,052
Yeah.

763
00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:15,487
Remember you said that time
God must be a painter,

764
00:52:15,557 --> 00:52:18,355
because of all the colors,
at the governor's house?

765
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,223
You said that.

766
00:52:20,295 --> 00:52:22,456
I didn't think
you were listening.

767
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,026
I'm always listening.

768
00:52:33,308 --> 00:52:35,970
It's beautiful.

769
00:52:40,215 --> 00:52:41,978
[Chuckles]

770
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:54,922
Alicia, does our
relationship warrant
long-term commitment?

771
00:52:54,996 --> 00:52:56,759
'Cause I need
some kind of proof,

772
00:52:56,831 --> 00:52:59,061
some kind of verifiable,
empirical data.

773
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,704
[Laughs]

774
00:53:04,772 --> 00:53:07,832
I'm sorry,
just give me a moment...

775
00:53:09,344 --> 00:53:12,336
to redefine
my girlish notions
of romance.

776
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,845
A proof?

777
00:53:17,919 --> 00:53:19,511
Verifiable data.

778
00:53:19,587 --> 00:53:22,249
Um... okay.

779
00:53:24,192 --> 00:53:27,923
Well, how big
is the universe?

780
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,588
Infinite.

781
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,892
How do you know?

782
00:53:30,965 --> 00:53:32,728
I know because
all the data indicate it.

783
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,529
But it hasn't
been proven yet?
No.

784
00:53:34,602 --> 00:53:36,433
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

785
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:39,439
I don't, I just believe it.

786
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,099
Mmm.

787
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,941
It's the same
with love, I guess.

788
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,147
Now,

789
00:53:54,222 --> 00:53:56,349
the part that
you don't know...

790
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,359
is if I want
to marry you.

791
00:54:15,376 --> 00:54:18,004
[Applause]

792
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,514

Well done!

Oh, sweet pea.

795
00:54:31,259 --> 00:54:32,954
I love you.
Congratulations.

796
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:34,790

Get in.

Who's following us?

00:57:30,004 --> 00:57:31,494
Hi.

821
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,603
Where were you?

822
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,544
S-Sol...
Yeah, I talked to Sol.

823
00:57:41,616 --> 00:57:44,244
He said you left
the office hours ago.

824
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:49,284
Why didn't you
call me?

825
00:57:53,694 --> 00:57:55,355
Are you all right?

826
00:58:04,739 --> 00:58:06,331

Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

00:58:13,748 --> 00:58:16,046
John,
open the door.

831
00:58:17,752 --> 00:58:20,687
Come on, open the door!
Let me in!

832
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:22,723

William.

840
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:36,259
This is not what
I signed on for.

841
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:38,321
Every time
a car backfires
or a door slams...

842
00:59:38,399 --> 00:59:42,199
I understand...
better than you
could possibly imagine.

843
00:59:51,913 --> 00:59:54,438
You need
to calm down, John.

844
00:59:54,515 --> 00:59:57,143
Now listen to me.
We're closing in
on the bomb,

845
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,584
in large part
due to your work.

846
00:59:59,654 --> 01:00:02,282
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?

847
01:00:02,356 --> 01:00:05,189
William, my circumstance
has changed.

848
01:00:05,259 --> 01:00:07,591
Alicia's pregnant.

849
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:18,964
I told you attachments
were dangerous.

850
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,032
You chose to marry
the girl.

851
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:24,669
I did nothing
to prevent it.

852
01:00:27,381 --> 01:00:29,872
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety...

853
01:00:29,951 --> 01:00:32,112
is for you to continue
your work.

854
01:00:33,187 --> 01:00:34,779
Well, I'll just quit.

855
01:00:34,855 --> 01:00:36,652
You won't.

856
01:00:36,724 --> 01:00:38,316
Why would I not?

857
01:00:38,392 --> 01:00:41,520
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

working for me,

do that?

a guest lecture...

883
01:03:08,342 --> 01:03:10,503
by the inimitable
John Nash?"

884
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:15,478
What's wrong?

885
01:03:15,549 --> 01:03:20,646
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

886
01:03:20,721 --> 01:03:22,552
Well, now you tell me,
what is it?

887
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,818
[Woman]
Professor Nash!

888
01:03:24,892 --> 01:03:27,122
Welcome!

889
01:03:28,896 --> 01:03:30,625
After?

890
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:40,400
[John]
So, we see that
the... the zeroes,

891
01:03:40,474 --> 01:03:43,068
of the Reimann
Zeta function,

892
01:03:43,144 --> 01:03:45,874
correspond
to singularities...

893
01:03:45,946 --> 01:03:49,177
in space-time,

894
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:52,151
singularities
in space-time...

895
01:03:55,055 --> 01:03:57,922
and conventional
number theory...

896
01:03:59,894 --> 01:04:04,388
It breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

897
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:21,839
Sometimes
our expectations...

898
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:24,350
are betrayed
by the numbers.

899
01:04:24,418 --> 01:04:27,444
Variables are impossible
to assign any...

900
01:04:27,521 --> 01:04:30,081
rational value.

901
01:04:49,977 --> 01:04:52,036
Professor Nash!

902
01:05:01,822 --> 01:05:04,450
- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?

903
01:05:06,393 --> 01:05:08,657
Professor Nash,

904
01:05:08,729 --> 01:05:12,165
let's avoid a scene, shall we?

905
01:05:12,233 --> 01:05:14,258
What do you want?

906
01:05:14,335 --> 01:05:16,929
My name is Rosen,

907
01:05:17,004 --> 01:05:18,995
Dr. Rosen.
I'm a psychiatrist.

908
01:05:19,073 --> 01:05:22,167
Forgive me
if I don't seem
persuaded.

909
01:05:22,243 --> 01:05:24,905
I'd like you
to come with me, John.

910
01:05:25,913 --> 01:05:27,847
Just for a chat.

911
01:05:28,983 --> 01:05:30,917
It appears I have
no choice.

912
01:05:34,088 --> 01:05:35,555
Oh-hh!

913
01:05:42,529 --> 01:05:44,224
Help me!
Somebody!

914
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,793
[Screams]
Somebody!

915
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:53,306
Help me!
Get off me!

916
01:05:53,374 --> 01:05:55,706
I know who you are!
I know who you are!

917
01:05:55,776 --> 01:05:57,437
No, no, no,
no, don't.

918
01:05:57,511 --> 01:05:59,376
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

919
01:05:59,446 --> 01:06:01,277
Call somebody!
Call somebody, Charles!

920
01:06:01,348 --> 01:06:02,815
They're Russians!
Steady the leg.

921
01:06:02,883 --> 01:06:04,646
Get away from me.

922
01:06:04,718 --> 01:06:06,948
Stay away from me!

923
01:06:11,892 --> 01:06:14,383
[Dr. Rosen]
There, now.

924
01:06:14,461 --> 01:06:16,292
All better.

925
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,198
Everything's
all right here.
[Gasps]

926
01:06:24,038 --> 01:06:26,097
Watch your head.

927
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:58,502
[Dr. Rosen, Faintly]
John?

928
01:06:59,573 --> 01:07:01,598
Can you hear me?

929
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:12,741
[Whispering]

930
01:07:14,955 --> 01:07:17,389
Go easy now.

931
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:20,359
Thorazine takes
a little while
to wear off.

932
01:07:23,464 --> 01:07:25,728
Sorry about
the restraints.

933
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:28,359
You've got one hell
of a right hook.

934
01:07:28,435 --> 01:07:31,563
[Weakly]
Where am I?

935
01:07:31,638 --> 01:07:33,299
Ahem.

936
01:07:33,374 --> 01:07:35,706
MacArthur
Psychiatric Hospital.

937
01:07:38,645 --> 01:07:41,546
I find that
highly unlikely.

938
01:07:41,615 --> 01:07:43,105
You made
a mistake.

939
01:07:43,183 --> 01:07:47,085
My work is non-military
in application.

940
01:07:47,154 --> 01:07:49,645
Which work
is that, John?

941
01:07:51,792 --> 01:07:53,589
I don't know
anything.

942
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:56,220
[Laughs]
There's no good
in keeping secrets, you know.

943
01:07:58,632 --> 01:08:00,725
[Groans]

944
01:08:04,471 --> 01:08:06,666
[Buzzer]

945
01:08:12,479 --> 01:08:14,709
Charles?

946
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,674
Charles?

947
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,354
I didn't mean to get you
involved in this.

948
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:25,555
I'm... I'm sorry.

949
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,263
Charles?

950
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,873
The prodigal roommate
revealed.

951
01:08:44,278 --> 01:08:46,940
"Saw my name
on the lecture slate."

952
01:08:47,014 --> 01:08:49,141
You lying son
of a bitch!

953
01:08:49,216 --> 01:08:51,946
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

954
01:08:52,019 --> 01:08:54,613
How do you say,
"Charles Herman" in Russian?

955
01:08:54,688 --> 01:08:57,179
How do you say it
in Russian?

956
01:08:57,257 --> 01:09:00,556
There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.

957
01:09:00,627 --> 01:09:03,187
He's right there.
He's right there.

958
01:09:03,263 --> 01:09:06,357
Stop!
I don't know anything!

959
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:09,095
Stop!
I... I don't know anything!

960
01:09:11,572 --> 01:09:13,335
My name is John Nash.

961
01:09:13,407 --> 01:09:15,034
I'm being held
against my will.

962
01:09:15,108 --> 01:09:17,668
Somebody call
the Department of Defense.

963
01:09:17,744 --> 01:09:19,507
My name is John Nash.

964
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:22,071
I'm being held
against my will!

965
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,611
[Alicia]
What's wrong with him?

966
01:09:32,292 --> 01:09:34,556
John has
schizophrenia.

967
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:38,394
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

968
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:43,861
But...
But his work.

969
01:09:43,937 --> 01:09:46,167
He deals
with conspiracies...

970
01:09:47,174 --> 01:09:49,438
Yes, yes, I know.

971
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:53,674
In John's world,
these behaviors
are... accepted,

972
01:09:53,747 --> 01:09:55,374
encouraged.

973
01:09:55,449 --> 01:09:58,885
As such, his illness
may have gone untreated...

974
01:09:58,952 --> 01:10:00,749
far longer
than is typical.

975
01:10:01,855 --> 01:10:03,379
What do you mean?
How long?

976
01:10:03,457 --> 01:10:05,550
Possibly since
graduate school?

977
01:10:05,626 --> 01:10:08,891
At least that's when
his hallucinations
seem to have begun.

978
01:10:08,962 --> 01:10:11,294
What are you
talking about?
What hallucinations?

979
01:10:11,365 --> 01:10:13,595
One, so far,
that I am aware of.

980
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:17,068
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

981
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:20,573
Charles
isn't imaginary.

982
01:10:20,641 --> 01:10:23,235
He and John
have been best friends
since Princeton.

983
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:26,279
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

984
01:10:26,346 --> 01:10:29,247
He's always in town
for so little time,
lecturing.

985
01:10:29,316 --> 01:10:32,114
Was he at your wedding?
He had to teach.

986
01:10:32,185 --> 01:10:33,812
Have you ever
seen a picture of him,

987
01:10:33,887 --> 01:10:36,447
talked to him
on the telephone?
This is ridiculous.

988
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:38,718
I phoned Princeton.

989
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:40,623
According to their
housing records,

990
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,559
John lived alone.

991
01:10:45,499 --> 01:10:48,935
Now, which is more likely...
that your husband,

992
01:10:49,002 --> 01:10:51,266
a mathematician
with no military training,

993
01:10:51,338 --> 01:10:53,772
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians...

994
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,501
You're making him
sound crazy.

995
01:10:55,576 --> 01:10:58,807
...or, that he has
lost his grip on reality?

996
01:11:01,248 --> 01:11:02,943
Now the only way
I can help him...

997
01:11:03,016 --> 01:11:04,347
is to show him
the difference...

998
01:11:04,418 --> 01:11:07,182
between what's real...

999
01:11:07,254 --> 01:11:09,415
and what is in his mind.

1000
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,993
Come on.

1001
01:11:15,696 --> 01:11:17,960
What's he been
working on?

1002
01:11:18,031 --> 01:11:20,966
His work
is classified.

1003
01:11:21,034 --> 01:11:23,298
He mentioned
a supervisor...

1004
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:25,861
by the name
of William Parcher.

1005
01:11:25,939 --> 01:11:28,965
Maybe Mr. Parcher
can clarify things
for us.

1006
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:31,476
But I can't get to him
without clearances.

1007
01:11:32,379 --> 01:11:34,040
You want me to help you get...

1008
01:11:34,114 --> 01:11:36,139
the details
of my husband's work?

1009
01:11:37,551 --> 01:11:39,644
John thinks
I'm a Russian spy.

1010
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,688
Is that what
you think?

1011
01:11:46,393 --> 01:11:48,827
What did
the doctor say?
Is he sick?

1012
01:11:48,895 --> 01:11:50,522
I don't know.

1013
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,462
I want to see what John's
been working on.

1014
01:11:52,532 --> 01:11:55,501
You know you can't
go in his office.
It's classified, Alicia.

1015
01:11:55,569 --> 01:11:57,537
Stop. Oh!

1016
01:12:10,484 --> 01:12:12,782
Oh, my God.

1017
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:18,824
Oh, my God.

1018
01:12:25,766 --> 01:12:28,735
Why didn't you
say something?

1019
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:31,862
Alicia,
John's always been...

1020
01:12:31,938 --> 01:12:34,270
a little weird.

1021
01:12:34,341 --> 01:12:36,536
He said he was
doing code-breaking,

1022
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:38,771
that it was eyes-only.

1023
01:12:38,845 --> 01:12:41,837
Top secret, part
of the military effort.
Was he?

1024
01:12:41,915 --> 01:12:44,383
Well,
it was possible,
you know?

1025
01:12:44,451 --> 01:12:45,884
Directives come down
all the time...

1026
01:12:45,952 --> 01:12:47,351
that some of us
aren't cleared for.

1027
01:12:47,421 --> 01:12:49,889
- It was possible.
- Possible, but...

1028
01:12:49,956 --> 01:12:51,753
not likely.

1029
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:56,224
Lately, he'd become
so much more agitated...

1030
01:12:56,296 --> 01:12:58,457
and then
when you called...

1031
01:12:58,532 --> 01:13:01,126
So, is this all
he's been doing
every day?

1032
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:03,533
Cutting out
magazines?

1033
01:13:05,138 --> 01:13:07,800
Well, not all.

1034
01:14:08,368 --> 01:14:10,768
[Door Opens]

1035
01:14:29,055 --> 01:14:32,456
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

1036
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,753
I missed you.
I missed you.

1037
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,134
I have to talk
to you.

1038
01:14:42,202 --> 01:14:44,261
Okay.

1039
01:14:48,909 --> 01:14:51,537
Alicia, I've been
thinking about it,

1040
01:14:51,611 --> 01:14:55,206
and I do realize
that my behavior...

1041
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:58,376
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you...

1042
01:14:58,451 --> 01:15:00,885
must have appeared
insane.

1043
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:03,149
I left you
with no other choice.

1044
01:15:03,223 --> 01:15:05,384
I do understand...

1045
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:08,325
and I'm truly sorry.
That's okay.

1046
01:15:09,729 --> 01:15:11,959
Everything's
gonna be all right.

1047
01:15:13,466 --> 01:15:15,627
Everything's
gonna be all right.

1048
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,634
We just have to talk quietly.

1049
01:15:20,173 --> 01:15:24,371
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

1050
01:15:24,444 --> 01:15:27,038
I'm gonna tell you
everything now.

1051
01:15:27,113 --> 01:15:29,547
It's breaking
with protocol...

1052
01:15:29,616 --> 01:15:31,550
but you need
to know,

1053
01:15:31,618 --> 01:15:35,486
because you
have to help me
get out of here.

1054
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:40,216
I've been doing
top secret work
for the government.

1055
01:15:40,293 --> 01:15:42,022
There's a threat
that exists...

1056
01:15:42,095 --> 01:15:44,757
of catastrophic

1407
01:47:29,968 --> 01:47:32,061
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

1408
01:47:32,137 --> 01:47:33,729
Tell him your work is critical.

1409
01:47:33,805 --> 01:47:36,069
John, please!

1410
01:47:49,654 --> 01:47:53,215
Is there any chance
that you could ignore
what I just did?

1411
01:47:54,893 --> 01:47:57,760
Of course,
what are old friends for?

1412
01:47:57,829 --> 01:48:01,492
Is that what we are, Martin?
Friends?

1413
01:48:01,566 --> 01:48:03,659
John, of course.

1414
01:48:03,735 --> 01:48:06,465
Of course.
We always have been.

1415
01:48:11,676 --> 01:48:13,610
Alicia and I think that...

1416
01:48:13,678 --> 01:48:15,509
that fitting in,

1417
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:17,571
being part of a community,

1418
01:48:19,851 --> 01:48:21,614
might do me some good.

1419
01:48:21,686 --> 01:48:23,586
That a certain level
of attachment,

1420
01:48:23,655 --> 01:48:25,646
familiar places,
familiar people,

1421
01:48:27,158 --> 01:48:28,921
might help me...

1422
01:48:28,993 --> 01:48:31,484
elbow out these...

1423
01:48:34,833 --> 01:48:37,802
these certain delusions
that I have.

1424
01:48:42,507 --> 01:48:45,135
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

1425
01:48:47,545 --> 01:48:49,706
I'm quite certain
that you will just say no.

1426
01:48:53,017 --> 01:48:55,815
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

1427
01:48:56,855 --> 01:48:58,789
[Sighs]

1428
01:49:04,529 --> 01:49:05,996
Huh.

1429
01:49:10,034 --> 01:49:12,195
Will you be needing an office?

1430
01:49:16,541 --> 01:49:18,372
No.

1431
01:49:21,212 --> 01:49:24,113
No, I could just work
out of the library.

1432
01:49:24,182 --> 01:49:26,742
Well, this guy tries
to wander into the library,

1433
01:49:26,818 --> 01:49:29,981
but he doesn't have I.D.
Why can't people read
their memos, huh?

1434
01:49:30,054 --> 01:49:31,783
Then he goes
totally nuts.

1435
01:49:31,856 --> 01:49:34,086
[John]
Not real! You're not real.

1436
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:36,023
There's no mission.

1437
01:49:36,094 --> 01:49:38,392
Oh, shit. Shit.

1438
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:42,192
Not real!
You are not real!

1439
01:49:42,267 --> 01:49:44,167
Is this what you are, soldier?

1440
01:49:44,235 --> 01:49:45,497
Some useless ghoul?

1441
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:47,595
The local madman?

1442
01:49:47,672 --> 01:49:50,300
I'm not a soldier.
You're gonna end up
in a cell!

1443
01:49:50,375 --> 01:49:52,639
Old, worthless,
discarded.

1444
01:49:52,710 --> 01:49:53,938
There's no mission.

1445
01:49:54,012 --> 01:49:55,639
And while you rock
and drool,

1446
01:49:55,713 --> 01:49:57,271
the world will
burn to ashes!

1447
01:49:57,348 --> 01:49:59,782
You are not real!
You are not real!

1448
01:49:59,851 --> 01:50:01,512
You're still talking
to me, soldier.

1449
01:50:01,586 --> 01:50:04,885
There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!

1450
01:50:04,956 --> 01:50:06,617
John? John?

1451
01:50:06,691 --> 01:50:08,522
John, John, John, John.

1452
01:50:08,593 --> 01:50:09,958
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

1453
01:50:10,028 --> 01:50:11,552
John, John!
It's okay.

1454
01:50:11,629 --> 01:50:13,790
I just heard what happened,
I'm sorry. John...

1455
01:50:13,865 --> 01:50:16,026
I'm not a soldier.
John. Hey, Nash.

1456
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:19,536
Nash, hey.
Hey, you're all right.

1457
01:50:21,072 --> 01:50:23,199
Nash, Nash,
hey, hey, hey.

1458
01:50:26,945 --> 01:50:29,846
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1459
01:50:29,914 --> 01:50:31,074
John?

1460
01:50:33,217 --> 01:50:35,845
[John]
You should've seen their faces.

1461
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:38,650
Everybody was
just staring at me.

1462
01:50:38,723 --> 01:50:40,350
John...

1463
01:50:40,425 --> 01:50:43,588
you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1464
01:50:43,661 --> 01:50:45,891
I know.

1465
01:50:48,132 --> 01:50:50,225
But then,
on the way home,

1466
01:50:50,301 --> 01:50:53,134
Charles was there.

1467
01:50:56,975 --> 01:51:00,308
Sometimes, I really miss
talking to him.

1468
01:51:03,247 --> 01:51:05,613
Maybe Rosen's right.

1469
01:51:05,683 --> 01:51:09,210
Maybe I have to think
about going back into
the hospital again.

1470
01:51:09,287 --> 01:51:11,255
No.

1471
01:51:11,322 --> 01:51:13,586
Come here.

1472
01:51:16,928 --> 01:51:19,761
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1473
01:51:43,821 --> 01:51:47,222
John, now, you can't
ignore me forever.

1474
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:54,760
Charles, you've been
a very good friend to me.

1475
01:51:54,832 --> 01:51:56,493
The best.

1476
01:51:58,202 --> 01:52:00,966
But I won't talk to you again.

1477
01:52:04,342 --> 01:52:06,503
I just can't.

1478
01:52:11,749 --> 01:52:14,274
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1479
01:52:14,352 --> 01:52:16,411
[Sniffs]

1480
01:52:22,093 --> 01:52:23,754
Good-bye.

1481
01:52:30,902 --> 01:52:32,733
Good-bye.

1482
01:52:46,684 --> 01:52:49,175
I was wondering if I might
audit your course.

1483
01:52:50,588 --> 01:52:53,580
It's... It's an honor,
Professor Nash.

1484
01:52:56,794 --> 01:52:58,887
Is something wrong?

1485
01:53:00,198 --> 01:53:02,496
This will be
my first class.

1486
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:04,694
[Laughs]

1487
01:53:05,903 --> 01:53:08,497
Good morning,

1488
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:10,768
eager young minds.

1489
01:53:17,949 --> 01:53:20,042
[Muttering Numbers]

1490
01:53:30,595 --> 01:53:32,893
It's never
gonna work, John.

1491
01:53:32,964 --> 01:53:35,455
You're just
humiliating yourself.

1492
01:53:38,069 --> 01:53:40,196
It's pathetic!

1493
01:53:40,271 --> 01:53:42,330
You are being
pathetic.

1494
01:53:42,406 --> 01:53:44,397
I'm ashamed of you.

1495
01:53:59,157 --> 01:54:01,648
[Laughing]

1496
01:54:09,133 --> 01:54:11,567
[Laughing Continues]

1497
01:54:11,636 --> 01:54:13,695
Oh, man!

1498
01:54:17,441 --> 01:54:20,433
Are you coming?
You're gonna be late.

1499
01:54:23,214 --> 01:54:25,079
Dad, you've got my books.
What?

1500
01:54:25,149 --> 01:54:26,776
You've got my books.

1501
01:54:26,851 --> 01:54:29,285
Oh, right.

1502
01:54:29,353 --> 01:54:30,786
Thanks.

1503
01:54:31,822 --> 01:54:33,551
Good-bye.
Bye.

1504
01:54:33,624 --> 01:54:35,421
[Alicia]
See you tonight.

1505
01:54:35,493 --> 01:54:37,461
Bye, honey.

1506
01:56:09,954 --> 01:56:11,546
Did you just solve Reimann?

1507
01:56:11,622 --> 01:56:13,817
Well, what
do you think?

1508
01:56:13,891 --> 01:56:16,917
Huh.
That's an analog
to Frobenius...

1509
01:56:16,994 --> 01:56:18,985
for noncommutative
extensions.

1510
01:56:19,063 --> 01:56:20,087
[Chuckles]

1511
01:56:20,164 --> 01:56:22,428
Yes, it is.

1512
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:25,492
But it only appears
to work sporadically, so, no.

1513
01:56:25,569 --> 01:56:27,696
But...

1514
01:56:27,772 --> 01:56:30,070
I believe I'm
making progress.

1515
01:56:31,108 --> 01:56:33,076
You're...

1516
01:56:33,144 --> 01:56:35,977
You're John Nash, right?

1517
01:56:38,449 --> 01:56:40,542
Toby Kelly.
Hello.

1518
01:56:40,618 --> 01:56:42,415
I've been studying
your equilibrium.

1519
01:56:42,486 --> 01:56:44,511
The one you wrote
here, at Princeton.

1520
01:56:44,588 --> 01:56:47,079
To come up with something
totally original, the way you did.

1521
01:56:47,158 --> 01:56:48,591
You know, I was young.
[Chuckles]

1522
01:56:48,659 --> 01:56:50,217
Umm...

1523
01:56:50,294 --> 01:56:52,660
I've been developing
a theory.

1524
01:57:06,977 --> 01:57:09,138
I believe I can prove...

1525
01:57:09,213 --> 01:57:11,977
that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1526
01:57:12,049 --> 01:57:14,449
That everything,
everything is connected.

1527
01:57:14,518 --> 01:57:17,180
That it's all part
of the same subject.

1528
01:57:18,389 --> 01:57:20,289
When was the last time
you ate?

1529
01:57:20,358 --> 01:57:22,918
Excuse me?
You know, food.

1530
01:57:22,993 --> 01:57:24,961
Oh, uh...

1531
01:57:25,029 --> 01:57:26,997
My wife,

1532
01:57:27,064 --> 01:57:28,929
she loves mayonnaise.

1533
01:57:28,999 --> 01:57:32,230
Oh, thank you.

1534
01:57:32,303 --> 01:57:33,497
Thank you.

1535
01:57:34,538 --> 01:57:36,403
Go on.

1536
01:57:36,474 --> 01:57:38,567
The function...

1537
01:57:38,642 --> 01:57:40,576
is in the two categories.
Um-hmm.

1538
01:57:44,749 --> 01:57:46,410
[Hansen]
Alicia!

1539
01:57:46,484 --> 01:57:49,146
Alicia!

1540
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:52,417
[John]
...coming together
at maximum speed of...

1541
01:57:52,490 --> 01:57:54,583
let us say
10 miles per hour.

1542
01:57:54,658 --> 01:57:57,957
So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle B,

1543
01:57:58,028 --> 01:58:00,997
and the fly, who can travel
at 20 miles an hour,

1544
01:58:01,065 --> 01:58:02,692
leaves the tire
of bicycle B and it flies...

1545
01:58:02,767 --> 01:58:04,928
to the tire of bicycle A
and backwards and forwards...

1546
01:58:05,002 --> 01:58:07,334
and so on and so forth
until the two bikes collide...

1547
01:58:07,405 --> 01:58:09,168
and the poor little fly
is squashed.

1548
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:11,367
- [Chuckling]
- This is the important thing...

1549
01:58:11,442 --> 01:58:13,501
about actually focusing in
and comprehending...

1550
01:58:13,577 --> 01:58:15,602
the area that you're
dealing with.

1551
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:18,512
Mathematics is very specific,
and it is an art form,

1552
01:58:18,582 --> 01:58:20,880
no matter what these
people around here
will tell you,

1553
01:58:20,951 --> 01:58:22,384
especially the people
from biology.

1554
01:58:22,453 --> 01:58:24,011
Don't listen to any
of those people.

1555
01:58:24,088 --> 01:58:26,386
Let me go back
to what you were doing before.

1556
01:58:26,457 --> 01:58:29,756
I might want to steal this,
write a book and get famous.

1557
01:58:31,028 --> 01:58:33,189
I was thinking
that I might teach.

1558
01:58:34,598 --> 01:58:36,691
A classroom
with 50 students...

1559
01:58:36,767 --> 01:58:39,736
can be daunting
for anyone.

1560
01:58:39,804 --> 01:58:42,637
John, besides,
you're a terrible
teacher.

1561
01:58:43,808 --> 01:58:46,641
I'm an acquired
taste, Martin.

1562
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:49,679
I was hoping there still
might be something
I could contribute.

1563
01:58:49,747 --> 01:58:51,715
What about the...

1564
01:58:51,782 --> 01:58:53,875
Well, you know.

1565
01:58:53,951 --> 01:58:56,283
Are they gone?

1566
01:59:02,293 --> 01:59:05,228
No, they're not gone.

1567
01:59:05,296 --> 01:59:06,888
And maybe they
never will be.

1568
01:59:06,964 --> 01:59:08,727
But I've gotten used
to ignoring them...

1569
01:59:08,799 --> 01:59:12,200
and I think as a result
they've kind of given up on me.

1570
01:59:12,269 --> 01:59:14,203
You think that's
what it's like...

1571
01:59:14,271 --> 01:59:17,934
with all our dreams
and our nightmares, Martin?

1572
01:59:18,008 --> 01:59:21,068
You've got to keep
feeding them for them
to stay alive?

1573
01:59:21,145 --> 01:59:24,603
John, they...
haunt you, though.

1574
01:59:24,682 --> 01:59:29,415
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody's haunted by their past.

1575
01:59:32,423 --> 01:59:34,357
Well, good-bye.

1576
01:59:34,425 --> 01:59:36,859
John, I'll talk
to the department.

1577
01:59:38,829 --> 01:59:40,660
Maybe
in the spring.

1578
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:48,101
Hey, Nash?

1579
01:59:49,773 --> 01:59:53,800
You... You scared?

1580
01:59:56,280 --> 01:59:58,214
Terrified.

1581
01:59:58,282 --> 02:00:00,648
Mortified.
Petrified.

1582
02:00:00,718 --> 02:00:03,448
Stupefied by you.

1583
02:00:03,521 --> 02:00:04,886
Now you ought best
ring Alicia,

1584
02:00:04,955 --> 02:00:07,048
or you're gonna get me...
I'll ring her.

1585
02:00:07,124 --> 02:00:08,455
In an awful
lot of trouble.

1586
02:00:12,363 --> 02:00:14,126
Thanks, Professor.
Good-bye.

1587
02:00:14,198 --> 02:00:16,132
Have a nice day.
Good-bye.

1588
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:19,067
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.

1589
02:00:19,136 --> 02:00:21,127
Professor Nash?

1590
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:26,969
Can you see him?
Yeah.

1591
02:00:27,044 --> 02:00:28,636
You sure?
Uh-huh.

1592
02:00:28,712 --> 02:00:30,907
Positive?
He's within your vision?

1593
02:00:30,981 --> 02:00:32,573
- [Laughing]
- Okay. Good.

1594
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:35,642
Forgive me, I'm just
always suspicious of new people.

1595
02:00:35,719 --> 02:00:38,051
See you next week,
Professor.
See you next week.

1596
02:00:39,356 --> 02:00:40,983
So now that I know
that you're real,

1597
02:00:41,058 --> 02:00:43,526
who are you,
and what can I
do for you?

1598
02:00:43,594 --> 02:00:46,995
Professor, my name
is Thomas King...

1599
02:00:47,064 --> 02:00:48,190
Thomas King?
Mm-hm.

1600
02:00:48,265 --> 02:00:49,755
And I'm here
to tell you...

1601
02:00:49,833 --> 02:00:52,859
that you're
being considered
for the Nobel Prize.

1602
02:01:00,411 --> 02:01:03,141
[John]
Forgive me, but I'm just
a little stunned.

1603
02:01:03,213 --> 02:01:05,681
[King]
Over the past few years
your equilibrium...

1604
02:01:05,749 --> 02:01:08,343
has become a cornerstone
of modern economics.

1605
02:01:08,419 --> 02:01:10,683
Suddenly everybody
likes that one.

1606
02:01:10,754 --> 02:01:15,054
What about my work
on other some such projects...
manifold embedding?

1607
02:01:15,125 --> 02:01:18,356
The application
of your bargaining problem...

1608
02:01:18,429 --> 02:01:22,729
to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...

1609
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,529
Antitrust cases?
Yes.

1610
02:01:24,602 --> 02:01:26,900
I never would have
considered that.

1611
02:01:26,971 --> 02:01:28,563
Well...
Have I just reached...

1612
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:31,369
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1613
02:01:31,442 --> 02:01:33,342
[Laughs]
No, no, you haven't.

1614
02:01:33,410 --> 02:01:35,401
'Cause, I wouldn't
have thought of that.

1615
02:01:40,551 --> 02:01:42,610
Shall we have tea?

1616
02:01:44,588 --> 02:01:46,920
Oh, I don't go in there.
I usually just...

1617
02:01:46,991 --> 02:01:48,891
take my sandwich
in the library.

1618
02:01:48,959 --> 02:01:52,918
Come on, John.
Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

1619
02:01:52,997 --> 02:01:55,056
M-Most...

1620
02:01:55,132 --> 02:01:57,032
Most commercially
available brands of tea...

1621
02:01:57,101 --> 02:01:58,728
are not suitable
to my palate.

1622
02:01:58,802 --> 02:02:00,531
I'm not...

1623
02:02:00,604 --> 02:02:03,732
There are some
Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough...

1624
02:02:03,807 --> 02:02:06,401
I enjoy the flavor
that they have...

1625
02:02:06,477 --> 02:02:08,206
I have not been
in this room...

1626
02:02:08,278 --> 02:02:11,270
for some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.

1627
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:14,577
[John]
Why, thank you,
young lady.

1628
02:02:16,954 --> 02:02:19,286
Things have certainly
changed around here.

1629
02:02:19,356 --> 02:02:21,620
I have a son that age.

1630
02:02:21,692 --> 02:02:24,661
Harvard.
[Chuckles]

1631
02:02:27,865 --> 02:02:29,958
Hmm.

1632
02:02:30,034 --> 02:02:32,594
I would have thought
the nominations...

1633
02:02:32,670 --> 02:02:35,138
for the Nobel Prize
would have been secret.

1634
02:02:35,205 --> 02:02:36,968
I would have thought
you'd only find out...

1635
02:02:37,041 --> 02:02:38,633
if you won or lost.

1636
02:02:38,709 --> 02:02:40,904
That is generally
the case, yes.

1637
02:02:40,978 --> 02:02:43,105
But these are
special circumstances.

1638
02:02:44,381 --> 02:02:46,713
The awards
are substantial.

1639
02:02:46,784 --> 02:02:51,312
They require
private funding.
As such,

1640
02:02:51,388 --> 02:02:54,380
the image
of the Nobel is...

1641
02:02:55,993 --> 02:02:58,723
I see. You came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1642
02:02:59,997 --> 02:03:02,227
Find out if I would...

1643
02:03:02,299 --> 02:03:04,290
screw everything up
if I actually won?

1644
02:03:06,203 --> 02:03:08,967
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk
like a chicken,

1645
02:03:09,039 --> 02:03:10,438
things of this nature?

1646
02:03:10,507 --> 02:03:12,975
Something
like that, yes.

1647
02:03:13,977 --> 02:03:15,968
Would I
embarrass you?

1648
02:03:19,516 --> 02:03:21,643
Yes, it is possible.

1649
02:03:24,388 --> 02:03:26,481
You see, I...

1650
02:03:27,224 --> 02:03:29,522
I am crazy.

1651
02:03:31,562 --> 02:03:33,689
I take the newer
medications,

1652
02:03:37,101 --> 02:03:40,093
but I still see things
that are not here.

1653
02:03:42,339 --> 02:03:44,534
I just choose
not to acknowledge them.

1654
02:03:46,677 --> 02:03:48,508
Like a diet of the mind,

1655
02:03:48,579 --> 02:03:51,013
I choose not to indulge
certain appetites.

1656
02:03:53,417 --> 02:03:56,284
Like my appetite
for patterns.

1657
02:03:57,921 --> 02:04:01,880
Perhaps my appetite
to imagine and to dream.

1658
02:04:02,926 --> 02:04:04,860
[Man]
Professor Nash.

1659
02:04:08,966 --> 02:04:12,402
It's good to have
you here, John.

1660
02:04:12,469 --> 02:04:14,403
Thank you.

1661
02:04:18,609 --> 02:04:23,046
It's an honor, sir.
Thank you very much.

1662
02:04:23,113 --> 02:04:24,808
A privilege,
Professor.

1663
02:04:29,119 --> 02:04:30,586
Professor.

1664
02:04:35,959 --> 02:04:38,951
Nicely done, John.
Thank you, Tom.

1665
02:04:40,130 --> 02:04:41,893
Thank you.

1666
02:04:41,965 --> 02:04:44,661
Thank you.

1667
02:04:52,776 --> 02:04:55,074
Thank you, Ed.

1668
02:05:02,653 --> 02:05:05,588
That was certainly
most unexpected.

1669
02:05:05,656 --> 02:05:08,921
[Applause]

1670
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:28,840
[John]
Thank you.

1671
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:32,874
[Applause Fades]

1672
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:35,282
I've always believed in numbers.

1673
02:05:35,352 --> 02:05:37,912
In the equations and logics...

1674
02:05:37,988 --> 02:05:39,922
that lead to reason.

1675
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:42,891
But after a lifetime
of such pursuits,

1676
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:45,451
I ask,

1677
02:05:45,529 --> 02:05:48,089
what truly is logic?

1678
02:05:48,165 --> 02:05:51,293
Who decides reason?

1679
02:05:52,736 --> 02:05:56,172
My quest has taken me
through the physical,

1680
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:58,140
the metaphysical,

1681
02:05:59,576 --> 02:06:01,544
the delusional...

1682
02:06:02,679 --> 02:06:04,670
and back.

1683
02:06:06,750 --> 02:06:09,583
And I have made
the most important
discovery of my career.

1684
02:06:11,555 --> 02:06:14,854
The most important discovery
of my life.

1685
02:06:17,327 --> 02:06:20,922
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love...

1686
02:06:20,998 --> 02:06:23,990
that any logical
reasons can be found.

1687
02:06:27,404 --> 02:06:30,669
I'm only here tonight
because of you.

1688
02:06:31,909 --> 02:06:34,901
You are
the reason I am.

1689
02:06:38,582 --> 02:06:41,415
You are all my reasons.

1690
02:06:45,255 --> 02:06:47,348
Thank you.

1691
02:07:40,978 --> 02:07:43,446
[John]
So nice to have
met you.

1692
02:07:46,149 --> 02:07:47,946
I'll call
for the car, Dad.

1693
02:07:48,018 --> 02:07:49,508
Bye bye.

1694
02:07:49,586 --> 02:07:51,247
[Woman]
Bye bye.

1695
02:07:51,321 --> 02:07:54,256
Are you ready to go now?
Oh, yes, I am.

1696
02:07:54,324 --> 02:07:56,884
Yes, indeed,
and yes, please.

1697
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:59,758
Thank you so much.

1698
02:07:59,830 --> 02:08:01,161
Thank you.

1699
02:08:03,700 --> 02:08:05,930
What is it?
What's wrong?

1700
02:08:09,706 --> 02:08:11,537
Nothing.

1701
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:14,541
Nothing at all.

1702
02:08:16,513 --> 02:08:19,141
Come with me,
young lady.
Oh-hh...

1703
02:08:19,216 --> 02:08:21,707
I have a car outside.

1704
02:08:21,785 --> 02:08:24,276
Are you interested
in a ride?

1705
02:08:25,322 --> 02:08:27,051
Where's it going to?

1706
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:50,973
I will

1707
02:08:51,048 --> 02:08:54,575
Watch you

1708
02:08:54,651 --> 02:09:01,454
In the darkness

1709
02:09:01,525 --> 02:09:05,359
Show you

1710
02:09:05,429 --> 02:09:08,921
Love will

1711
02:09:08,999 --> 02:09:15,063
See you through

1712
02:09:16,873 --> 02:09:24,211
When the bad dreams

1713
02:09:24,281 --> 02:09:31,346
Wake you crying

1714
02:09:31,421 --> 02:09:37,485
I'll show you

1715
02:09:37,561 --> 02:09:45,696
All love can do

1716
02:09:46,970 --> 02:09:54,035
What love can do

1717
02:09:54,111 --> 02:09:58,047
I will watch
through the night

1718
02:09:58,115 --> 02:10:02,211
Hold you in my arms

1719
02:10:02,285 --> 02:10:03,980
Give you dreams

1720
02:10:04,054 --> 02:10:09,219
Where none will be

1721
02:10:09,292 --> 02:10:13,422
I will watch
through the dark

1722
02:10:13,497 --> 02:10:17,228
Till the morning comes

1723
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:20,235
All the light

1724
02:10:20,303 --> 02:10:22,601
I'll take you
through the night

1725
02:10:22,672 --> 02:10:25,505
To see

1726
02:10:26,510 --> 02:10:29,570
The light

1727
02:10:29,646 --> 02:10:32,911
Showing us all love

1728
02:10:32,983 --> 02:10:37,750
Can be

1729
02:10:39,089 --> 02:10:42,183
I will

1730
02:10:42,259 --> 02:10:45,592
Guard you

1731
02:10:45,662 --> 02:10:53,569
With my bright wings

1732
02:10:53,637 --> 02:11:00,941
Stay till your heart

1733
02:11:01,011 --> 02:11:09,749
Learns to see

1734
02:11:09,819 --> 02:11:15,257
All love

1735
02:11:15,325 --> 02:11:19,785
Can...

1736
02:11:19,863 --> 02:11:27,895
Be

1737
02:13:52,282 --> 02:13:56,616
[Female Vocalizing]
