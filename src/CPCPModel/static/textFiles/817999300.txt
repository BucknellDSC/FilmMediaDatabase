   And I didn't sleep           
   on the plane.

     It's all going to be fine. 
     It always is.              
     Just follow the plan.

229
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:42,313

       idiot, that maybe        
       after the deal is done   

230
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:45,716
  which it definitely will be,  
  maybe we could just take off.

00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:56,693
 Well, they're not.             

442
00:38:56,761 --> 00:38:58,228
           As long as           
           we're not here.      

443
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:01,582
      Anybody know you're here? 

444

00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:05,185
            Somebody knows      
            you're here?        

446
00:39:05,254 --> 00:39:06,253
          No.                   

447
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,389

           you're not there?

 Ah, Jimmy! Jesus!              

450
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:15,629
   You call me up at 2:00 a.m.! 
   What the fuck you want?      

451
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:18,565
 I fucking told you.            
             She asked me       
             where I was going! 

452
00:39:22,438 --> 00:39:24,404
 What did you say?              

453
00:39:24,472 --> 00:39:26,506
           I told her I had     
           to run out a minute. 

454
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,061
 You trust her?                 

455
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,779
   Is this the kind             
   of shit you used             
   to do to my dad?             

456
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:36,183
              Do you trust her? 
 Yes, I fucking trust her!      
 All right?                     

457
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:39,119
 All right, good.               
 Good. You're at                
 home. I'm at home.             

458
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:42,923

 at 5:00 a.m. for Pilates.      

459
00:39:42,991 --> 00:39:45,559
 I'll be there next to her.     
 That's where I've been         
 all night long.

 with yours.

 This is some pretty            
 fucked up shit.

 Don't think about it.          

463
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:52,516
            No! Fuck that, man! 

464
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:53,900
     I don't hear from you      
     since the fucking funeral.

        out of the blue         
        using my father's name? 

466

         Is that what you want? 
         I will give you money! 

467

 I will give you 5,000...       
 I'll give you 10,000!          

468

 20,000! I'll give you          
 whatever you fucking...

           out of my car!       

471
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:12,970

   You want that?               
   You wanna fucking walk home? 

472
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:15,472

 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

 I'm not myself right now.

 you picked me up.              

475
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:25,482

 You helped me.                 
 I need your help.

               happened to you?

          a hospital right now.

              No, I just got    
              to get home.      

482

   Robert, it looks like        
   you're bleeding inside, man. 

483
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,087
          I'll deal with it     
          in a couple of hours. 

484

        make it a couple hours? 

485
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:52,009
         Then I don't make it.

501
00:43:19,475 --> 00:43:21,658
              What?             
 I woke up and                  
 you weren't here.              

502
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,414
             I just went to get 
             some ice cream.

 Okay.

             You still love me?

 Of course I do.                

510
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,887
 Hypothetically,                
 the situation                  
 you're describing              

511
00:44:07,956 --> 00:44:10,640
 would be involuntary           
 manslaughter.                  

512
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:12,041
          That such a person... 

513
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:14,144
      Would be in               
      a lot of trouble.         

514
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:17,881
 Especially if that person      
 were closing a merger          
 with a large public bank       

515
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:23,320
 where any publicity            
 or arrest could delay          
 or derail the transaction.     

516
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:26,055
 But that's only if             
 there were some evidence       

517
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:28,392
   that could link              
   him to the crime.            

518
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,893
          Fingerprints. DNA?    

519
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:32,362
 Very hard to collect           
 after an explosion.            

520
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:34,731
 Real world's different         
 from television.               

521
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:39,236
            What about          
            cell phone records? 

522
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:41,888
     Did this person            
     make any calls             
     from the area?             

523
00:44:41,957 --> 00:44:43,323
            Not from            
            the cell phone. No. 

524
00:44:43,392 --> 00:44:46,560
 Then they won't be able        
 to place him there.            

525
00:44:46,628 --> 00:44:49,479
          What would you advise 
          such a person to do?  

526
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:52,599
 To confess immediately.        

527
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:55,151
         Failing which?         

528
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:59,021
 To put as much                 
 distance between himself       
 and the event as possible.     

529
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:02,058
       If possible.             
       But let me tell          
       you something.           

530
00:45:03,395 --> 00:45:06,329
    And I'm speaking to you     
    as a friend now.            

531
00:45:06,398 --> 00:45:09,716
 There's about 50 things        
 that person wouldn't           
 have thought of.               

532
00:45:09,785 --> 00:45:13,503
 And the more time that passes, 
 the more lies that are told.   

533
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:15,438
    The worse it gets for him.  

534
00:45:17,992 --> 00:45:19,292
 Robert?                        

535
00:45:19,827 --> 00:45:21,445
                    Yeah.       

536
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:24,064

537
00:45:24,132 --> 00:45:25,749
               I know.          

538
00:45:25,817 --> 00:45:27,918
   And the accident is          
   not the worst trouble.       

539
00:45:27,986 --> 00:45:31,288
 If we talk to them now         
 we can probably work it out.   

540
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:33,740
            Now you tell me     
            what happens        

541
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:35,942

         does not close.        

542
00:45:36,011 --> 00:45:38,711
           I've got to tell     
           my investors about   
           our real losses.     

543
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,880

         what they decide       
         to arrest me on?       

546
00:45:44,787 --> 00:45:47,403

         gets me 20 years?      

547
00:45:47,472 --> 00:45:48,471
                 I did.         

548
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,995
           What choice

551
00:46:15,634 --> 00:46:18,050
 ROBERT: Of course I am aware.  
 I gave testimony               
 to the committee.              

552
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:19,669
     You know this.             

553
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:22,372
     I know.                    
     But anyway, Standard wants 
     to prepare for it now      

554
00:46:22,374 --> 00:46:24,474
        so I was asked          
        to go through every one 
        of your trading books   

555
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:25,892
      and reconfirm the assets. 

556
00:46:25,961 --> 00:46:28,261
   No. Absolutely not.          
   It's impossible.             

557
00:46:28,464 --> 00:46:30,179
           Don't worry.         
           I gave different     
           books to the team    

558
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:31,914
        and I kept Old Hill     
        for myself.             

559
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:35,568
      Anyway, I'm here          
      to tell you I cleared it. 

560
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:36,802
  The audit's cleared?          

561
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:38,538
               The report will  
               be issued today. 

562
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:40,523
       Actually, I'm calling it 
       my swan song.            

563
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,327
     You're leaving?            

564
00:46:44,395 --> 00:46:45,545
           Yeah. On Friday.     
           You know, it's a     
           five-year clock.     

565
00:46:45,614 --> 00:46:46,696
         And why?               

566
00:46:46,698 --> 00:46:48,582
         To prevent exactly     
         what we're doing.      

567
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,536
    But honestly,               
    there is nothing left       
    to worry about. It's great. 

568
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:54,704

 to see Mr. Miller.

   I was only there             
   a couple of minutes.         
   I think I left around 10:00.

                  Yeah.

00:50:25,951 --> 00:50:28,501
       Okay. So now back        
       to the gallery.          

644
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,703
 Did you see her                
 with anyone?                   

645
00:50:30,772 --> 00:50:32,204
             See her with?      
             What do you mean?  

646
00:50:32,273 --> 00:50:35,408
 Like a boyfriend.              
 Someone she might              
 have left with?                

647
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:39,779
        Not that I noticed. No. 

648
00:50:39,848 --> 00:50:43,349
      The reason I ask is       
      we haven't located        
      the driver.               

649
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:45,184
              The driver?       
 Yeah, the driver.              

650
00:50:45,253 --> 00:50:47,620
          Someone else          
          was driving.          

651
00:50:47,689 --> 00:50:54,227
      Sometimes the driver      
      will go for help          
      and he'll die trying.     

652
00:50:54,296 --> 00:50:57,263
           This is awful.       
           This is truly awful. 

653
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:58,614

      the area right now.       

654
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:00,967
 So, no boyfriend?              

655
00:51:01,603 --> 00:51:03,069
 That you know of.              

656
00:51:03,138 --> 00:51:05,454
       Actually, we didn't talk 
       about personal matters.  

657
00:51:05,456 --> 00:51:06,806
        She was just            
        an employee, right?     

658
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,641
         Well, not an employee. 
         I was an investor.     

659
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:10,443
    Why'd you invest?           
              Why did I invest? 

660
00:51:10,511 --> 00:51:11,927
         Why'd you invest?      

661
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,864
           She had a great eye. 

662
00:51:14,933 --> 00:51:17,450
      Actually, she found me    
      these Brice Mardens here. 

663
00:51:17,518 --> 00:51:19,269
            They went up in     
            value very quickly. 

664
00:51:19,337 --> 00:51:20,502
             And it was on      
             the basis of that  

665
00:51:20,571 --> 00:51:23,105
          that I agreed to fund 
          some of the gallery.  

666
00:51:23,174 --> 00:51:24,606
           Uh-huh.              

667
00:51:24,675 --> 00:51:26,542
    You mind if we              
    search her apartment?       

668
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:29,979
            Why would I mind?   
 It's in your                   
 company's name, so.            

669
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:32,281
    Right. Oh, yeah. Of course. 

670
00:51:32,984 --> 00:51:34,951
         Sure. Yeah, go ahead.  

671
00:51:35,019 --> 00:51:37,786
       Now, Mr. Miller.         
                       Mmm-hmm? 

672
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,722
      (CLEARS THROAT)           

673
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,558
 Why would you lease            
 an apartment for Miss Cote?    

674
00:51:42,627 --> 00:51:45,628
     Is that something          
     you normally do            
     for an employee?           

675
00:51:45,696 --> 00:51:47,930
           Actually, I said she 
           wasn't an employee.  

676
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:49,632
                 But, she...    

677
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,068
          I think she'd just    
          come over from Paris, 
          if I remember.        

678
00:51:52,137 --> 00:51:54,620
         And she needed a place 
         to entertain buyers.   

679
00:51:54,689 --> 00:51:55,888
      So you leased             
      her an apartment?         

680
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:58,107
          Well, it was through  
          the holding company.  

681
00:51:58,175 --> 00:52:00,960
          You are a little      
          confused by all this, 
          aren't you?           

682
00:52:01,029 --> 00:52:03,812
 I am. But I'll get there.      
 Give me time.                  

683
00:52:03,881 --> 00:52:05,882
                All right.      

684
00:52:05,951 --> 00:52:08,451
 I don't mean to be             
 indelicate. But...             

685
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:11,971
              But you're going  
              to be indelicate. 

686
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,507
   From what I can gather,      
   she wasn't exactly           
   an art star.                 

687
00:52:14,576 --> 00:52:16,659
 She worked for                 
 a couple of dealers            
 in Paris, but...               

688
00:52:16,727 --> 00:52:19,779
   I get it.                    
   So why would I invest in her 
   and help her find a place?   

689
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:20,763
      Something like that.      

690
00:52:20,831 --> 00:52:22,498
              It's very simple, 
              Detective.        

691
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:25,134
           I invest in people   
           I believe in.        

692
00:52:25,203 --> 00:52:28,754
       I thought she'd do well. 
       I backed her. She did.   

693
00:52:28,823 --> 00:52:30,923
        It's as simple as that. 

694
00:52:30,992 --> 00:52:33,709
            Well, that seems    
            to make sense.      

695
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:34,811
      We're all good with       
      the apartment then,       
      right?                    

696
00:52:34,879 --> 00:52:36,095
         Yeah, yeah.            
         That's fine. Go ahead. 

697
00:52:36,163 --> 00:52:37,079
              Thanks.           

698
00:52:37,148 --> 00:52:38,698
            What happened       
            to your head?       

699
00:52:38,766 --> 00:52:40,015
             What?              

700
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:41,918
    Your head.                  
    What happened to your head? 
    That's a nasty cut.         

701
00:52:41,986 --> 00:52:43,820
     I've been looking at that  
     for the last five minutes. 
     Does it hurt you?          

702
00:52:43,888 --> 00:52:46,422
       No, I just... I hit it   
       on the medicine cabinet. 

703
00:52:47,308 --> 00:52:48,440
           Last night?          

704
00:52:49,794 --> 00:52:51,227
             This morning.      

705
00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:54,413
    Hate when that happens.     
                Me, too.        

706
00:52:54,482 --> 00:52:55,464
  Well, thanks for the chat.    

707
00:52:56,368 --> 00:52:57,733
               No problem.      

708
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:06,892
         (PHONE RINGING)        

709

         Ellen Miller's office. 

710
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,330
 And it transformed them.       
 Seriously.                     

711
00:53:11,399 --> 00:53:13,816
            There's a Detective 
            Bryer in the lobby. 

712
00:53:13,885 --> 00:53:16,369
 And thanks again               
 for your generosity.           

713
00:53:16,438 --> 00:53:17,903
   All right.                   
   I'll see you then.           
   Bye-bye.                     

714
00:53:17,972 --> 00:53:20,706
       Sorry. What?             
               Detective Bryer? 

715
00:53:20,775 --> 00:53:22,908
    What does he want?          
                  I don't know. 

716
00:53:22,977 --> 00:53:25,962
        Well, I'm late.         
        So I just can't         
        deal with it right now. 

717
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,630
 Okay. What about these?        

718
00:53:27,699 --> 00:53:29,281
   Send them a thank you note.  
   Zappos has been so generous. 

719
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,349
 Thanks! Bye, guys.             

720
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:39,675
            Mrs. Miller?        
             Yes?               

721
00:53:40,445 --> 00:53:41,677
    Detective Bryer.            

722
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:43,346
                Did you just    
                call my office? 

723
00:53:43,414 --> 00:53:44,580
 Yeah. I was hoping             
 to talk to you.                

724
00:53:44,649 --> 00:53:46,849
         Oh, I don't have       
         time right now. Sorry. 

725
00:53:46,918 --> 00:53:49,585
       It will just take        
       a couple of seconds.     
       It's about your husband. 

726
00:53:49,587 --> 00:53:52,605
   Well, fine.                  
   But make an appointment.     

727
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,713
     How'd it go?               

728
00:54:18,616 --> 00:54:20,132
          The wife blew me off. 

729
00:54:20,868 --> 00:54:22,534
         Which was interesting. 

730
00:54:24,072 --> 00:54:25,504
            And he didn't admit 
            to the affair.      

731
00:54:25,573 --> 00:54:26,772
          But then he wouldn't, 
          would he?             

732
00:54:26,841 --> 00:54:28,190
  Why didn't you                
  pick him up?                  

733
00:54:28,259 --> 00:54:29,825
          He's a very rich man. 

734
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:33,096
          Anything?             

735
00:54:33,164 --> 00:54:35,331
 Yeah. About 10 million prints. 

736
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,816
          What happened         
          with the pay phones?  

737
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:38,584
 There were about 15 calls      
 in a three-mile.               

738
00:54:38,653 --> 00:54:40,119
 Two of them look               
 a little strange.              

739
00:54:40,188 --> 00:54:42,371
 Got an incoming.               
 Probably a local drug deal.    

740
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,555
          Anyone we care about? 

741
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:45,424
     A collect call.            
     About a minute             
     and a half.                

742
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:47,510
 Made from the Chevron station  
 on Westlake Road.              

743
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:48,911
             Who'd he call?     

744
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,414
 Cell phone in Harlem.          
 Still waiting                  
 on the address.                

745
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:55,384
  So, you're at the crash site. 

746
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,988
    All right? And you make it  
    out of the car.             

747
00:55:00,174 --> 00:55:04,726
        Now you're smart enough 
        not to use your         
        own cell phone.         

748
00:55:04,795 --> 00:55:08,413
   So you get to the pay phone. 
   And you're a billionaire.    

749
00:55:08,482 --> 00:55:09,998
          Right?                
          You're a billionaire. 

750
00:55:10,701 --> 00:55:11,833
            So what do you do?  

751
00:55:13,504 --> 00:55:15,038
      You call someone          
      in Harlem?                

752
00:55:19,844 --> 00:55:20,893
                        Robert? 

753
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:25,280
      I just heard about Julie. 
      I'm so sorry.             

754
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:28,484
     Her gallery called.        
     Her mom's flying in today. 

755
00:55:28,553 --> 00:55:29,385
         Her mom?               

756
00:55:31,572 --> 00:55:32,622
       Service here?            

757
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,423
         Tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.    

758
00:55:34,492 --> 00:55:38,294
  We should pick up             
  the expenses for that.        
  Whatever she wants.           

759
00:55:38,362 --> 00:55:39,829
 You'll take care of that       
 personally for me?             

760
00:55:39,897 --> 00:55:41,331
            Of course.          
        Thanks.                 

761
00:55:41,399 --> 00:55:42,798
           You all right?       

762
00:55:42,867 --> 00:55:44,817
      You get a hold            
      of Mayfield?              

763
00:55:44,885 --> 00:55:47,403
 No. Not yet.                   
 But we'll get him.             
 Robert?                        

764
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,839
 I...                           

765
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:51,757
             Thanks.            

766
00:55:51,825 --> 00:55:53,125

00:56:11,513 --> 00:56:13,496
  What's this about?            
    Just get in the car, Jimmy. 

772
00:56:13,564 --> 00:56:14,947
        Am I under arrest?      

773
00:56:15,016 --> 00:56:16,182
              You wanna be?     

774
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:20,920
           BRYER: Okay,         
           let's do this again. 

775
00:56:20,988 --> 00:56:22,422
       Man, for what?           
       My answers ain't         
       gonna change.            

776
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:25,525
           So, you were asleep? 

777
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:27,159
              Right.            

778
00:56:27,228 --> 00:56:28,610
   And the phone rings.         

779
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,012
                       Right.   

780
00:56:30,081 --> 00:56:34,350
 And it's a wrong number.       

781
00:56:34,418 --> 00:56:38,270
 Why did you accept             
 the charges on a collect call  
 from a wrong number?           

782
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:40,489
     I don't think              
     I want to answer           
     any more questions.        

783
00:56:40,558 --> 00:56:44,610
       And then you stay on     
       the phone for a minute   
       and a half               

784
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:46,179

785
00:56:46,247 --> 00:56:48,013
          What the fuck         
          did you talk about?   
          Area codes?           

786
00:56:48,082 --> 00:56:49,215
        I want to talk          
        to my lawyer.           

787
00:56:49,283 --> 00:56:51,117
            Listen, big man.    
            We know you         
            went down there.    

788
00:56:51,185 --> 00:56:52,918
             We ID'd your photo 
             with your neighbor 
             who saw you        

789
00:56:52,987 --> 00:56:55,120
            get into your truck 
            10 minutes after    
            the call was made.  

790
00:56:55,189 --> 00:56:57,406
          If you got all that,  
          what the fuck you     
          need me for, Officer? 

791
00:56:57,475 --> 00:57:00,209
       I don't think you        
       understand the gravity   
       of the situation here,   

792
00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:02,528
              Jimmy.            

793
00:57:03,698 --> 00:57:05,264
         This is a homicide.    

794
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,032

              sign him out?     

796
00:57:10,004 --> 00:57:11,486
 I called in Earl Monroe.       

797
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:14,673
         The basketball player? 

798
00:57:14,742 --> 00:57:17,810
 Civil rights attorney.         
 Remember Crown Heights?        

799
00:57:17,879 --> 00:57:19,245
                 He's the best? 

800
00:57:19,313 --> 00:57:21,730
 He's the best                  
 above 96th Street.             

801
00:57:21,799 --> 00:57:23,899
 And that doesn't               
 make him any cheaper.          

802
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:29,655
           You've got to get    
           Jimmy out of this.   

803
00:57:29,724 --> 00:57:31,257
 It might not be that easy.     

804
00:57:31,325 --> 00:57:35,611
 If he doesn't cooperate,       
 they're likely to indict him   
 on obstruction.                

805
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,146
             What would he      
             be looking at?     

806
00:57:37,215 --> 00:57:38,680
         Hard to say.           

807
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:42,150
     With his prior,            
     five years. Maybe 10.

           about anything here. 

812
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:09,544

           to anyone else.

         needed a fucking ride. 

816
00:58:30,451 --> 00:58:32,268
          You didn't tell me    
          you killed that girl. 
        Jimmy, I didn't kill...

    but now you're              
    taking it too far.

         own son for this?      

823
00:58:44,198 --> 00:58:45,397
          Why the hell you      
          didn't call him?      

824
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,518
    'Cause he would have        
    fucked it up, all right?

     Okay then, Syd.            
     Tell us, what happens now? 

828
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:55,991
        We meet with Earl       
        and we go from there.   

829
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,961

   they don't have enough       
   to charge you with anything. 

830
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,597
     You're under suspicion.    
 JIMMY: Under suspicion?

00:59:05,069 --> 00:59:07,019

     would you like

 I get out.

          have just stayed?     

838
00:59:22,303 --> 00:59:24,403
                    I couldn't. 
              Why not?          

839
00:59:24,405 --> 00:59:26,872

 Oh, Peter. Listen,             
 I'm looking at some

       How much did you         
       book last quarter?       

884

 <i> Why? What do you care?</i>        

885

 <i> All right, 35.</i>

     Can't you just

 Who do you think asked me      
 to make those changes?         

908
01:02:34,028 --> 01:02:36,194
            You tell me.

 he got probation?

                   Why didn't   
                   you tell me? 

987

990
01:07:15,609 --> 01:07:17,175

991

         right to my face. Why? 

996
01:07:31,092 --> 01:07:33,208
 Because we were going broke!   

997
01:07:34,077 --> 01:07:35,310
 Everything was finished!       

998
01:07:35,979 --> 01:07:37,112
     We'd have nothing.         

999
01:07:37,114 --> 01:07:38,163
     How? How does that happen? 

1000
01:07:38,231 --> 01:07:39,264
 How?                           

1001
01:07:40,668 --> 01:07:43,468
 You remember Alexandrov?       

1002
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:46,321
    He came to see me           
    one day last year.          

1003
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:49,758
     He said,                   
     "Robert, we've got         
     a great opportunity.       

1004
01:07:49,827 --> 01:07:52,427
   "There's                     
   a copper mine in Russia.     
   It's under-exploited.        

1005
01:07:52,496 --> 01:07:54,696
     "There's billions          
     under the ground.          

1006
01:07:54,765 --> 01:07:57,131
 "To get it out all we need     
 is a couple hundred million.   

1007
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,768
    "You put in a hundred.      
    We'll put in a hundred.     

1008
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:02,637
      "We'll triple it          
      in six months."           

1009
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:07,342
 I was skeptical,               
 so I go check it out.          

1010
01:08:07,411 --> 01:08:11,179
 The geological survey's right. 
 A friendly government.         

1011
01:08:11,248 --> 01:08:14,582
     And to lock it in,         
     you hedge it.              

1012
01:08:15,452 --> 01:08:16,951
           Right?               

1013
01:08:17,021 --> 01:08:18,620
   We sell the copper ahead.    

1014
01:08:18,688 --> 01:08:21,189
  The commodities exchange      
  and it all works. It's fine.  

1015
01:08:21,258 --> 01:08:23,425
 We're making a fortune.        

1016
01:08:23,493 --> 01:08:26,461
 And then there was something   
 I hadn't accounted for.        

1017
01:08:27,914 --> 01:08:28,913
    A variation in margin.      

1018
01:08:30,617 --> 01:08:31,950
     And that friendly          
     Russian government,        

1019
01:08:32,019 --> 01:08:34,686
    not so friendly anymore.    
    They're blocking            
    the exported copper.        

1020
01:08:34,755 --> 01:08:36,054
 So I gotta pony up.            

1021
01:08:36,122 --> 01:08:38,523
 I've got to put                
 the cash in to                 
 cover the hedge.               

1022
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:40,425
 But I'm not worried            
 about it 'cause it's           
 still springing money!         

1023
01:08:40,494 --> 01:08:43,328
 There's so much                
 money coming out of this.      
 You can't believe it.          

1024
01:08:43,397 --> 01:08:47,499
 You can't stop it. And yes.    
 You know? I am the oracle.     

1025
01:08:47,568 --> 01:08:51,670
 I have done housing.           
 I have arb'd credit swaps.     
 I've done it all.              

1026
01:08:51,738 --> 01:08:54,973
 And yes! I know!               
 It's outside the charter,      

1027
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:56,841
     but it is fucking          
     minting money!             

1028
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:58,743
    It is a license             
    to print money!             

1029
01:08:58,812 --> 01:09:01,813
   For everybody!               
   Forever! It is God!          

1030
01:09:05,802 --> 01:09:07,335
               Until?           

1031
01:09:07,404 --> 01:09:09,771
     Until it's not.            

1032
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:12,407
   The money is trapped.        
   I can't get it out.          

1033
01:09:13,377 --> 01:09:15,443
   Probably never will.         

1034
01:09:15,512 --> 01:09:18,029
 Like a plane crash.            
 It just happens.               

1035
01:09:18,098 --> 01:09:19,831
       It does not just happen. 

1036
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,450
 It just happened, honey.       
 You are so naive sometimes.    

1037
01:09:22,519 --> 01:09:26,521
 You're young,                  
 but you're not that young.     
 It happens.                    

1038
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:30,625
 And like any father,           
 I pray that it doesn't         
 happen to you.                 

1039
01:09:30,694 --> 01:09:32,677
 Happily, because of me         
 it won't happen to you.        

1040
01:09:32,746 --> 01:09:34,612
        Thanks to you           
        we may all be arrested. 

1041
01:09:34,681 --> 01:09:36,999
 No one's getting arrested.     

1042
01:09:37,067 --> 01:09:39,067
 That's why I borrowed          
 the money from Jeffrey.        

1043
01:09:39,703 --> 01:09:41,436
     Plugged the hole.          

1044
01:09:41,505 --> 01:09:43,938
    They see that               
    the books are fine.         

1045
01:09:44,007 --> 01:09:47,709
   Transfer the company.        
   I pay back Jeffrey,          
   with interest!               

1046
01:09:47,777 --> 01:09:51,413
 I make all of our              
 investors whole,               
 and what's left we keep.       

1047
01:09:51,482 --> 01:09:53,047
 At least we get                
 to keep the house.             

1048
01:09:53,117 --> 01:09:55,233
              Everybody wins!   
         Yes.                   

1049
01:09:55,302 --> 01:09:56,735
        If we sell the company. 

1050
01:09:56,804 --> 01:09:57,803
 It'll sell.                    

1051
01:09:57,871 --> 01:09:59,370
         If I lie for you.      

1052
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:00,855
 You don't have to lie.         
 You didn't know about it.      

1053
01:10:00,924 --> 01:10:02,156
     That's why                 
     I didn't tell you!         

1054
01:10:02,225 --> 01:10:04,158
             I'm the Chief      
             Investment Officer 
             of this company.   

1055
01:10:04,227 --> 01:10:04,993
           What do you think    
           they're going to say 
           at the deposition?   

1056
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:06,361
             "She didn't know"? 

1057
01:10:06,429 --> 01:10:08,663
          They'll take away     
          my brokerage license. 

1058
01:10:08,732 --> 01:10:10,499
      Failure to supervise you! 

1059
01:10:10,567 --> 01:10:12,200
               My name in every 
               paper and blog,  

1060
01:10:12,268 --> 01:10:13,968
              while I visit     
              your ass in jail? 

1061
01:10:14,037 --> 01:10:16,188
     Did you want me            
     to let our investors       
     go bankrupt?               

1062
01:10:16,256 --> 01:10:19,357
  Is that what you wanted?      
  You wanted people             
  to get really hurt?           

1063
01:10:19,426 --> 01:10:22,010
  What gives you                
  the audacity to think that... 
 You want those lies to...      

1064
01:10:22,078 --> 01:10:23,562
 Because it's my job!           

1065
01:10:23,631 --> 01:10:25,697
          Job! It's illegal!    
      Yes.                      

1066
01:10:25,766 --> 01:10:28,634
         It's illegal.          
         And I am your partner. 

1067
01:10:28,636 --> 01:10:31,687
 You are not my partner!        
 You work for me!               

1068
01:10:31,755 --> 01:10:33,639
  That's right!                 
  You work for me!              

1069
01:10:36,009 --> 01:10:37,926
 Everybody works for me!        

1070
01:10:46,236 --> 01:10:47,685
          Come here.            

1071
01:10:47,754 --> 01:10:49,754
 Brooke, please? Please?        

1072
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,573
 Come here. Just...             

1073
01:10:52,642 --> 01:10:54,092
 Just for a second.             
 Sit down.                      

1074
01:11:02,002 --> 01:11:04,736
              There's something 
              I wanna tell you. 

1075
01:11:04,805 --> 01:11:06,805
           Whatever you decide, 
           I won't blame you.   

1076
01:11:09,126 --> 01:11:10,792
            I'm on my own path. 

1077
01:11:12,662 --> 01:11:14,997
         It's up to you to move 
         with it or against it. 

1078
01:11:16,183 --> 01:11:18,549
         But I'm the patriarch. 
         That's my role.        

1079
01:11:19,953 --> 01:11:21,486
         And I have to play it. 

1080
01:11:24,942 --> 01:11:28,043
       For a moment there,      
       I thought you were going 
       to say you were sorry.   

1081
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:42,841
        I'm sorry.              

1082
01:11:50,867 --> 01:11:51,999
           Hey, Jimmy?          

1083
01:11:53,036 --> 01:11:54,986
  Come on, man! What?           

1084
01:11:54,988 --> 01:11:56,121
           Take a ride with me. 

1085
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,023
 Where? Back to the station?    

1086
01:11:58,091 --> 01:11:59,775
           No, man.             
           Just get in the car. 

1087
01:12:00,644 --> 01:12:02,376
    What if I say no?           

1088
01:12:02,445 --> 01:12:04,663
       I'm not threatening you. 
       I'm just asking you.     

1089
01:12:05,499 --> 01:12:06,965
           Take a ride with me. 

1090
01:12:19,612 --> 01:12:21,362
 You're wasting my time,        
 Detective. What?               

1091
01:12:22,815 --> 01:12:25,283
              Look, it's pretty 
              fucking simple.   

1092
01:12:25,352 --> 01:12:27,685
                I know you went 
                to pick him up. 

1093
01:12:27,754 --> 01:12:29,470
     So that's what you         
     want to talk about?        

1094
01:12:29,539 --> 01:12:31,322
 I told you I ain't             
 making no more statements.     

1095
01:12:31,391 --> 01:12:32,707
            I want to know why. 

1096
01:12:32,776 --> 01:12:33,842
       Somebody cares?          

1097
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:35,260
     Here. Take a look at this. 

1098
01:12:36,313 --> 01:12:38,313
                       Take it. 

1099
01:12:38,381 --> 01:12:42,000
    I've got his phone calls.   
    I've got his text messages. 

1100
01:12:42,069 --> 01:12:44,486
      I've got his relationship 
      with the girl.            

1101
01:12:44,554 --> 01:12:46,654
   They were fucking,           
   by the way.                  

1102
01:12:46,723 --> 01:12:49,074
         And then I've got you. 

1103
01:12:49,143 --> 01:12:51,493
          I've got the time log 
          from the pay phone.   

1104
01:12:51,562 --> 01:12:53,962
         I've got a fucking     
         tollbooth photograph   

1105
01:12:54,031 --> 01:12:55,947
      of you driving            
      through the Triborough.   

1106
01:12:58,335 --> 01:12:59,567
 What do you got there?         

1107
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:03,905
      That's bullshit.          
      'Cause I ain't do it.     
      It's impossible.          

1108
01:13:04,574 --> 01:13:05,540
              Really?           

1109
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,828
          Look. You lied to me. 

1110
01:13:09,896 --> 01:13:11,362

01:24:47,309 --> 01:24:49,410
 We're gonna say                
 there's no deal.               
 There never was a deal.        

1329
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:52,046
 You're not going               
 to be buying Old Hill.         

1330
01:24:52,115 --> 01:24:53,481
 You're not going               
 to be buying Quantum.          

1331

 You're not going               
 to be buying anything.

 to enjoy my earnings.

01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:09,413
   to my next                   
   winning enterprise,

   your shares are              
   going to drop another        
   couple of bucks              

1337
01:25:11,717 --> 01:25:15,319
  based on a failed             
  acquisition attempt.          

1338
01:25:16,956 --> 01:25:19,306
 Bodes well for your tenure,    
 doesn't it?                    

1339
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:20,991

 You have a nice day, James.    

1342
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:28,816
                           400. 

1343

1344
01:25:31,787 --> 01:25:33,237
                   450.         

1345
01:25:33,306 --> 01:25:36,624
   525. And that's it.          
   Yes or no?                   

1346
01:25:36,693 --> 01:25:39,326
 And if it's no,                
 that's it for any              
 further communications.        

1347
01:25:39,395 --> 01:25:41,111
   It goes right                
   into my trashcan.            

1348
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,329
              It's a deal.      

1349
01:25:43,966 --> 01:25:45,115
   One other thing.             

1350

 Six months,                    
 I'm going to be gone.          
 I'm out of here.               

1351

 to take it over.

 And you're going to have       
 to make my son a VP.

1356
01:26:02,684 --> 01:26:03,934
   He doesn't have              
   to do anything.              

1357
01:26:04,003 --> 01:26:06,871
 He just gets a salary.         
 He gets the office.            

1358
01:26:06,939 --> 01:26:10,474
 Five-year employment           
 contract for both of them.     

1359
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:12,642
 My lawyers draft them.         
 Yes or no?                     

1360

 You're not serious.

                  I am serious.

1365
01:26:42,091 --> 01:26:44,475
  I'll send over a draft        
  of the press release.         

1366

               Yeah, I'm fine.

1372
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:09,450
 So we made a good deal?        
                    Yeah.       

1373
01:27:15,058 --> 01:27:18,225

       I would have taken four.

   I will be seeing most of you 
   at the gala tomorrow night.

     as of this afternoon

             talk about it now. 
             More questions?    

1377

 offer me a deal.

 I walk away.                   

1453
01:31:05,521 --> 01:31:08,689

 who I went to pick up.

 gonna file a case.

         approval, I'm going    
         to offer Mr. Deferlito 

1551
01:37:38,063 --> 01:37:41,181
         the opportunity        
         to voluntarily dismiss 
         the indictment         

1552
01:37:41,249 --> 01:37:43,049
         to save us all a bunch 
         of embarrassment.      

1553
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:44,985
         I don't feel           
         comfortable with that, 
         Your Honor.            

1554
01:37:45,053 --> 01:37:48,555
      Further, I'm going to put 
      all charges against       
      Mr. Grant under seal.     

1555
01:37:48,623 --> 01:37:51,474
        This case is dismissed  
        with prejudice and not  
        to be refiled.          

1556
01:37:51,543 --> 01:37:53,760
            Hold on, Detective! 

1557
01:37:53,828 --> 01:37:57,631
    If you have another suspect 
    in the automobile death     

1558
01:37:57,633 --> 01:38:00,850
                then you are    
                to present him. 

1559
01:38:00,919 --> 01:38:04,253
      But Mr. Grant is free     
      from any further inquiry. 

1560
01:38:04,322 --> 01:38:06,906
                 This is over.  
                 Do I have your 
                 understanding? 

1561
01:38:06,975 --> 01:38:08,241
                     Thank you. 

1562
01:38:12,263 --> 01:38:14,231
           Close the door,      
           Detective. Please.   

1563
01:38:21,457 --> 01:38:23,173
             You finessed this, 
             didn't you?        

1564
01:38:24,009 --> 01:38:25,241
       I'm sorry?               

1565
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:27,077
               You finessed it. 

1566
01:38:27,145 --> 01:38:29,630
               I know it        
               and you know it. 

1567
01:38:29,698 --> 01:38:30,948
                  I know who    
                  you're after. 

1568
01:38:31,016 --> 01:38:34,033
        I saw all the evidence. 
        Not just a toll photo.  

1569
01:38:34,102 --> 01:38:36,153
            You've got to get   
            him the right way.  

1570
01:38:36,755 --> 01:38:37,854
         Oh.                    

1571
01:38:38,623 --> 01:38:39,622
        Okay.                   

1572
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:45,228
         So, let me             
         get this straight.     

1573
01:38:45,297 --> 01:38:46,863
  What you're telling me        
  is I'm supposed to sit around 

1574
01:38:46,932 --> 01:38:48,665
        with my thumb up my ass 
        and my fingers crossed  

1575
01:38:48,733 --> 01:38:52,235
        hoping that one of      
        these fucking days,     
        somewhere down the line 

1576
01:38:52,304 --> 01:38:54,704
             one of these       
             rich assholes      

1577
01:38:54,773 --> 01:38:57,908
         is gonna say the wrong 
         thing loud enough      

1578
01:38:57,976 --> 01:39:00,877
        so that we can't choose 
        to ignore him anymore?  

1579
01:39:03,232 --> 01:39:05,331
              Get the fuck      
              out of my office. 

1580
01:39:07,385 --> 01:39:08,552
        Yes.                    

1581
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:10,620
 Your Honor.                    

1582
01:39:11,974 --> 01:39:13,657
       Well, when do            
       you expect her?          

1583
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:16,626
 When do you expect her?        

1584
01:39:18,296 --> 01:39:20,396
 So I don't have to call you    
 a ninth time,                  

1585
01:39:20,465 --> 01:39:22,331
           can you take down    
           what I'm saying?     

1586
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,467
        Word for word? Exactly? 

1587
01:39:25,203 --> 01:39:26,302
          You got a pencil?     

1588
01:39:27,105 --> 01:39:28,104
             Are you ready?     

1589
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:29,806
                 Okay.          

1590
01:39:29,875 --> 01:39:31,274
               Here goes.       

1591
01:39:31,343 --> 01:39:36,179
    Mrs. Miller,                
    exactly how fucking stupid  
    do you really think I am?   

1592
01:39:39,918 --> 01:39:42,151
                  You didn't    
                  hurt anybody. 

1593
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:44,604
               You helped       
               a lot of people. 

1594
01:39:44,673 --> 01:39:46,589
        And this piece of paper 
        makes everything okay?  

1595
01:39:46,925 --> 01:39:48,091
            No.                 

1596
01:39:49,861 --> 01:39:51,094
   It makes it easier.          

1597
01:39:52,464 --> 01:39:53,897
          You worried I'm gonna 
          say something?        

1598
01:39:56,201 --> 01:39:57,200
            No.                 

1599
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:03,523
         Robert, look,          
         you asked me to come   
         meet you and I'm here. 

1600
01:40:03,592 --> 01:40:05,792
      But I came because        
      I wanted to get something 
      straight between us.      

1601
01:40:07,529 --> 01:40:08,561
                We're even.     

1602
01:40:11,383 --> 01:40:12,815
     Okay. We're even.          

1603
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:16,386
 Just for the record though.    

1604
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:21,374
 What you did is                
 way beyond the money.          

1605
01:40:21,443 --> 01:40:23,026
               (SCOFFS)         

1606
01:40:23,095 --> 01:40:25,895
         Nothing is beyond      
         money for you, Robert. 
         We both know that.     

1607
01:40:25,964 --> 01:40:27,731
      Thanks a lot.             

1608
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,332
              If I take this,   

1609
01:40:30,969 --> 01:40:33,003
               what does that   
               say about me?    

1610
01:40:37,509 --> 01:40:38,959
                 Fuck it.       

1611
01:40:39,077 --> 01:40:40,377
               I'm gonna        
               take your money. 

1612
01:40:40,445 --> 01:40:41,828
         I'm gonna do something 
         good with it.          

1613
01:40:54,826 --> 01:40:55,858
               Hey, sweetie.    

1614
01:40:58,881 --> 01:41:01,181
          What time do you want 
          to get there?         

1615
01:41:01,249 --> 01:41:02,682
            I don't want to     
            get there too soon. 

1616
01:41:06,505 --> 01:41:08,105
 How late do you                
 think it will go?              

1617
01:41:11,793 --> 01:41:12,825
             You okay?          

1618
01:41:14,095 --> 01:41:15,312
             What is it?        

1619
01:41:16,514 --> 01:41:17,714
           You spoke to Brooke? 

1620
01:41:19,168 --> 01:41:20,467
         She told you that?     

1621
01:41:20,619 --> 01:41:22,752
        No, she didn't have to. 

1622
01:41:22,821 --> 01:41:24,103
           (SIGHS)              

1623
01:41:26,558 --> 01:41:27,990
     Yeah, I explained          
     to Brooke...               

1624
01:41:28,059 --> 01:41:30,110
             You explained?     

1625
01:41:30,178 --> 01:41:31,844
   Did you tell her everything? 

1626
01:41:32,614 --> 01:41:34,564
           Yeah. Yes.           

1627
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:36,800
               Everything.      

1628
01:41:40,739 --> 01:41:42,139
            Lift up your shirt. 

1629
01:41:42,841 --> 01:41:43,956
          What?                 

1630
01:41:44,026 --> 01:41:45,892
            Lift up your shirt. 

1631
01:41:52,383 --> 01:41:54,067
             Did you tell her   
             about this?        

1632
01:42:03,712 --> 01:42:05,545
 Ellen, I don't know            
 what you think you know.       

1633
01:42:05,614 --> 01:42:07,047
                 Don't treat me 
                 like an idiot. 

1634
01:42:07,115 --> 01:42:08,782
       You've been sneaking off 
       to see her for months.   

1635
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:09,699
   You don't think I know that? 
 What do you think you know?    

1636
01:42:09,768 --> 01:42:11,184
                 I never cared. 

1637
01:42:11,253 --> 01:42:13,386
              Really. About     
              your secretaries, 

1638
01:42:13,454 --> 01:42:15,388
               your gallerists, 
               your whores...   

1639
01:42:15,457 --> 01:42:16,589
             Whatever you       
             want to call them. 

1640
01:42:16,658 --> 01:42:18,708
        I cared about our home. 

1641
01:42:18,777 --> 01:42:20,777
      And now you've brought    
      this to our door.         

1642
01:42:20,846 --> 01:42:22,278
 I did what was necessary.      

1643
01:42:22,347 --> 01:42:24,197
         Oh, you did            
         what was necessary     
         for you, Robert.       

1644
01:42:24,266 --> 01:42:26,015
         For your interests.    
 For my interests?              

1645
01:42:26,084 --> 01:42:27,116
                     Yes.       

1646
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:29,953
 Everything I do is for us.     
 For this family.               

1647
01:42:30,022 --> 01:42:31,721
 And now you tell me            
 how to run my business?        

1648
01:42:31,790 --> 01:42:33,890
              This isn't about  
              your business.    
              This is our life. 

1649
01:42:33,959 --> 01:42:35,792
           Where do you think   
           we're going tonight? 

1650
01:42:35,861 --> 01:42:37,560
           Why do you think     
           I've tolerated all   
           of this for so long? 

1651
01:42:37,629 --> 01:42:38,628
   You tolerated?               

1652
01:42:38,697 --> 01:42:41,198
    (SCOFFS) Wow.               

1653
01:42:41,316 --> 01:42:43,066
               I'm glad you     
               find that funny. 
   What about me?               

1654
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:45,301
 What about the complaints?     

1655
01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:47,871
   The unhappiness?             
   The drinking?                

1656
01:42:47,939 --> 01:42:52,008
          The shopping?         
          The trainers?         
          Everything?           

1657
01:42:52,077 --> 01:42:55,045
  Yes! The charities.           
  The wonderful                 
  sainted charities.            

1658
01:42:55,113 --> 01:42:57,380
  All the wonderful             
  things that you do.           

1659
01:42:57,449 --> 01:42:59,049
    How do you think            
    I pay for them?             

1660
01:42:59,117 --> 01:43:03,036
      I didn't ask you because  
      I didn't want you to lie. 

1661
01:43:03,105 --> 01:43:04,904
           But I thought...     
 Because you didn't             
 want to give them up.          

1662
01:43:04,973 --> 01:43:06,722
       We had an understanding. 

1663
01:43:06,791 --> 01:43:10,376
      You broke that            
      understanding when you    
      brought Brooke into it... 

1664
01:43:10,445 --> 01:43:11,728
 No, I kept her out.            

1665
01:43:11,796 --> 01:43:14,814
    ...when you made            
    Brooke complicit,           
    when you risked her future. 

1666
01:43:14,883 --> 01:43:16,433
            And I'm done.

           to sign this thing?

1674

             No, I don't.       

1675

                   Okay.        

1676
01:43:59,611 --> 01:44:01,711
          The police have been  
          trying to talk to me. 

1677
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:04,848
        I assume because        
        they want to know where 
        you were that night.    

1678
01:44:05,817 --> 01:44:07,383
            And I'm not going   
            to lie for you.

 you sign that.

          find a way to manage. 

1682
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:17,610
      I'm sure you have         
      all kinds of things       
      offshore for a rainy day.

01:44:18,947 --> 01:44:22,382
     If you sign it,            
     then I will tell your lie. 

1685
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:27,671
          I will say that I was 
          with you that night   
          all night here.       

1686
01:44:27,773 --> 01:44:30,823
 And you will be                
 free and clear.                

1687
01:44:30,892 --> 01:44:33,026
            And the people      
            that need our money 
            will get it.

              That's my price.  

1689

    I'm not signing this.       
    I will not sign that!       

1690

         Well, then,            
         I'll have to tell them 
         that you came home     

1691
01:44:45,223 --> 01:44:48,408
          at 4:30,

1692
01:44:48,476 --> 01:44:50,727
     Why would you tell them?   
     That's fucking ridiculous! 

1693

            Are you trying      
            to blackmail me?    

1694
01:44:54,933 --> 01:44:56,749
          I think we call       
          it negotiating.       

1695

 You're not gonna win that one. 
 There's no fuckin' way.

01:44:59,288 --> 01:45:01,087
       You know what?           
       It'll cause just         
       enough trouble.

 that you don't want.           

1698
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,573
 And apparently,                
 according to my lawyer,        

1699
01:45:04,642 --> 01:45:08,011
 enough to give them            
 probable cause.                
          Fuckin' lawyer. Fuck!

01:45:08,079 --> 01:45:11,047

 subpoena your DNA              
 and your cell phone and...     

1701

      or you can be             
      at your business.         

1705
01:45:21,526 --> 01:45:22,858
  You won't do it.              

1706
01:45:25,096 --> 01:45:26,796
                You won't do it 
                to the kids.    

1707
01:45:27,932 --> 01:45:29,348
