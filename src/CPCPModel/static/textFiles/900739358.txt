00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:43,865

Whoa, my hair's gigantic.

695

We can listen to
whatever you like.

696
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:52,415
Can you put on talk radio?

697
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:54,580
Are you sure you don't
wanna listen to music?

698
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:57,520
I love talk radio.
It calms me.

699
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:00,486
So do I. I loved it
when I was a little girl.

00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:02,082
I used to think that
they were all my friends.

702
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:06,697
Sorry, that sounded
very sad.

703
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,255
(LAUGHS) Sorry.

704
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,426
I have a lot of friends,
so don't worry about me.

705
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:13,938
I mean, so I work a lot.
I do. And I could have
some more friends.

706
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:15,973
But how many friends
do you really need?

707
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:18,671
I mean, if you were
my parents asking me,

708
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,074
"Are you fulfilled and
are you happy, Grace?"

709
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:22,579

But we're not
having that conversation.

not your position to
ask me that at all. So...

There's no hustle.

I never said you were...

728
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:29,606
An idiot. Or 10.

Truth of the matter is,
I don't know how old you are.

Ten.
Well, now we know
that you're not an idiot.

people out there that are

732

that photo of us,

733
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,680
they thought that I would
make a great mayor.

Why?

735
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:43,885
Why? Because I'm a...

00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:46,095
I'm a rich guy.
I saved an orphan.

I'm not an orphan,
I'm a foster kid.

738

And you didn't save me.

Oh, I didn't save you?
I didn't just

740
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:52,897
push you out of
the way of a van?

741

Yes. Insane, isn't it?

00:55:52,663 --> 00:55:55,791
We went with
Annie to the movies,
and we got candy and soda,

1209
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:58,300
and we went ice skating,
and Mr. Stacks is so cool,

1210
00:55:58,368 --> 00:55:59,665

It's going back.

1214

Because you don't
deserve it.

1215

Yes, we do.
It's from our friend.

1216
00:56:07,544 --> 00:56:11,071
She's not your friend.
And neither is Mr. Stacks.

No matter who you
are or what you are,

1374
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,131
you just gotta
want it bad enough,
and work with what you got.

the start of your story

you'll get glory

their dreams come true

for Annie to wear
to the event tonight.

1435

It's gorgeous. I just
need you to tie the bow

1436
01:06:23,493 --> 01:06:24,482
and make sure
that the satin...

1437
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,618
I tie the bow?
Yeah.

You just have to tie the bow.

1439

No, I... (CLEARS THROAT)
What kind of bow?

1440
01:06:29,732 --> 01:06:30,960
It's just a simple bow.
Like a slipknot?

1441

'Cause you know I
didn't take Boy Scouts.

facing out.
The satin?

1444
01:06:35,872 --> 01:06:37,032
Yeah.
I knew a girl named Satin.

1445

I'm sure you did.
You don't need to elaborate.

not necessarily my...

a bow this big.

that you put the satin
on the outside of the bow.

Do I find him attractive?
Sure.

the physical sense.
But he is very good-looking.

and a great, chiseled face.

on the hair, sister.

That you care about her.

of the track right here?

1803
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:33,186
This is where my father
worked 20 hours a day.

1804
01:23:33,255 --> 01:23:34,984
Work, and work,
and work, and work.

1805
01:23:35,691 --> 01:23:38,091
And then, uh, he died.

1806
01:23:39,294 --> 01:23:40,591
I was 12 years old.

1807
01:23:41,163 --> 01:23:42,255

I don't know.
I barely knew him.

He was always working.

1810
01:23:46,268 --> 01:23:50,261
And that's why I felt like
if I worked hard enough,

1811
01:23:51,106 --> 01:23:52,869
then that'd probably
bring me closer to him.

1812
01:23:53,975 --> 01:23:58,002
And that's why
I developed this.

01:27:44,072 --> 01:27:46,597
We slept in the bed.

1888
01:27:47,609 --> 01:27:49,736
Which one
do you prefer, Will?

1889
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:52,041
Hmm?
Uh, red.

1890
01:27:53,915 --> 01:27:55,712
It's been two hours.
I don't think

1891
01:27:55,784 --> 01:27:57,843
she's completely learned
to read yet.

1892
01:27:57,919 --> 01:27:59,318
Yeah, well,
not completely, but...

1893
01:27:59,387 --> 01:28:01,048
GUY: Will! Will!

1894
01:28:01,356 --> 01:28:02,618
We got our game changer.

1895
01:28:02,691 --> 01:28:05,159
Every election
needs a game changer.
We got our game changer.

1896
01:28:05,226 --> 01:28:07,160
Stop saying "game changer."
Annie's parents.

1897
01:28:07,228 --> 01:28:09,753
They saw her picture,
and they called us.
It's a miracle.

1898
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:13,962
"Game changer."
Apparently, they've been
looking for her for years,

1899
01:28:14,035 --> 01:28:15,161
but she's not in the system.

1900
01:28:15,236 --> 01:28:16,965
How do they know
she's their daughter?

1901
01:28:17,038 --> 01:28:18,062
Well, they know
everything about her.

1902
01:28:18,139 --> 01:28:20,130
They know about the locket,
the note,

1903
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:22,608
and oh, yeah,
I ran a DNA test.

1904
01:28:23,612 --> 01:28:25,204
Boom goes the dynamite.

1905
01:28:29,284 --> 01:28:30,581
DNA test.

1906
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,044
(CLEARS THROAT)

1907
01:28:33,121 --> 01:28:35,021
All right,
but don't tell her.

1908
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:37,752
I wanna meet them
before Annie finds out.

1909
01:28:37,826 --> 01:28:38,815
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

1910
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:40,190
I mean, you should
totally be the one

1911
01:28:40,261 --> 01:28:42,354
(LOUDLY)
Who tells Annie that
we found her parents!

1912
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:43,988
You found my parents?

1913
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:47,601
Yes, honey, we did.
Well, we think so.

1914
01:28:47,669 --> 01:28:48,658
Really?

1915
01:28:48,737 --> 01:28:51,535
Uh, yeah.
We're gonna meet them
at a place called the Domani.

1916
01:28:51,606 --> 01:28:52,903
That's where
the note is from!
No way!

1917
01:28:52,974 --> 01:28:53,963
I knew they'd come for me.

1918
01:28:57,012 --> 01:28:58,036
Uh...

1919
01:28:58,113 --> 01:29:02,243
I'm happy for you, Annie.
I know this is what
you always wanted.

1920
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:03,646
And it's all because of you.

1921
01:29:11,259 --> 01:29:15,525
ANNIE: I can't believe
I'm gonna see my parents.
I'm kind of freaking out.

1922
01:29:15,764 --> 01:29:18,562
(CROWD CLAMORING,

1923
01:29:22,437 --> 01:29:23,768
REPORTER:
Annie! Annie! Over here!

1924
01:29:23,838 --> 01:29:25,362
Are you happy?
Are you happy?

1925
01:29:26,608 --> 01:29:27,870
Very happy for you.

1926
01:29:27,942 --> 01:29:29,170
Thanks.

1927
01:29:29,711 --> 01:29:31,440
Annie, The Reunion.

1928
01:29:34,449 --> 01:29:35,882
Annie.
My girl.

1929
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:36,939
(CHUCKLES)

1930
01:29:38,053 --> 01:29:40,283
Is it a match?
Let's see, huh?

1931
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:41,678
(GASPS)

1932
01:29:43,124 --> 01:29:44,887
It's a match.

1933
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:47,088
MOM: We thought
we'd lost you forever.

1934
01:29:47,162 --> 01:29:48,220
Me, too.

1935
01:29:48,296 --> 01:29:49,729
DAD: We fell upon hard times.

1936
01:29:49,798 --> 01:29:51,766
We just felt it was best
for someone else
to look after you.

1937
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:52,857
I figured.

1938
01:29:52,934 --> 01:29:54,629
I've never
forgiven myself for it.

1939
01:29:54,703 --> 01:29:56,364
But when we
got back on our feet,

1940
01:29:56,438 --> 01:29:57,996
well, we just
couldn't find you, kid.

1941
01:29:58,373 --> 01:30:00,466
But the angels
were looking out.

1942
01:30:00,842 --> 01:30:02,537
Where do you live?
New Jersey.

1943
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,441
Ooh.
(CHUCKLES)

1944
01:30:04,512 --> 01:30:06,639
But we're moving
to Brazil for my job.

1945
01:30:06,715 --> 01:30:07,943
I think you're gonna
like it there.

1946
01:30:08,016 --> 01:30:09,005
ANNIE: Cool.

1947
01:30:09,084 --> 01:30:10,574
GUY: Okay, let's get started.

1948
01:30:10,652 --> 01:30:12,347
Everything is, uh, in order.

1949
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:16,254
We have the DNA test
signed by the judge.

1950
01:30:16,324 --> 01:30:18,918
Now, we just need
signatures of the parents.

1951
01:30:18,993 --> 01:30:20,790
That's you guys.
That's us.

1952
01:30:22,497 --> 01:30:24,988
MRS. KOVACEVIC:
Ma'am, sign right there.

1953
01:30:25,066 --> 01:30:27,694
Hey. Remember me from before?

1954
01:30:27,769 --> 01:30:29,760
You know what, I do.
That's right.

1955
01:30:29,838 --> 01:30:31,965
I didn't know that you were
Annie's foster mom.

1956
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,837
Amongst other things.
I know.

1957
01:30:33,908 --> 01:30:35,239
She said that
you're a very good singer.

1958
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:36,436
What'd she say?

1959
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:38,809
(WHINY) "Oh!
She's a really good singer."

1960
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,074
No, she didn't do
any of that. She just said

1961
01:30:40,148 --> 01:30:42,514
you have a very nice voice,
and she liked it.

1962
01:30:43,351 --> 01:30:45,012
She did?
Yep.

1963
01:30:45,954 --> 01:30:48,889
Said it made her feel
good about herself.

1964
01:30:50,024 --> 01:30:51,218
MRS. KOVACEVIC:
Thank you, Rodney.

1965
01:30:51,292 --> 01:30:53,556
The guardian of record.

1966
01:30:53,628 --> 01:30:56,188
That's you, stretch.
Come on. Right here.

1967
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,524
You sure about this?

1968
01:30:59,601 --> 01:31:01,569
That this is gonna
win you the election?
Yeah.

1969
01:31:01,636 --> 01:31:04,127
No. Annie.

1970
01:31:04,205 --> 01:31:06,298
You don't pay me
to worry about her.

1971
01:31:06,608 --> 01:31:11,477
And the current
temporary guardian,
William Stacks.

1972
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:14,241
Mr. Stacks, we meet again.

1973
01:31:15,617 --> 01:31:17,107
That is a very big pen.

1974
01:31:19,087 --> 01:31:20,384
Thank you.

1975
01:31:20,455 --> 01:31:23,982
Okay. Well, according
to the State of New York,

1976
01:31:24,259 --> 01:31:27,524
you are officially reunited.

1977
01:31:27,595 --> 01:31:28,960
ANNIE: Yay!
Great!

1978
01:31:29,964 --> 01:31:32,865
We'll pick you up at 4:00.
Great.

(CLAMORING)

1980
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:36,964
All right.

REPORTER 2:
What were they like?

1982
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,400
Hey! Hey, hey, wait!

1983
01:31:40,475 --> 01:31:42,238
How did you do
the DNA test?

1984
01:31:42,777 --> 01:31:44,335
You can do
anything with money.

1985
01:31:44,412 --> 01:31:47,279
Well, who are those people,
and what's your plan
with her, anyhow?

1986
01:31:47,348 --> 01:31:49,612
Don't worry about it.
She served her purpose.

1987
01:31:49,684 --> 01:31:50,810
What does that mean?

1988
01:31:50,952 --> 01:31:52,544
That they'll hold her
for a while

1989
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,918
then dump her
back in the system
till after the election.

1990
01:31:54,989 --> 01:31:56,388
No harm, no foul.

1991
01:31:56,457 --> 01:31:58,482
You can't do that to her.
I mean,
she's still a little girl.

1992
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,495
What do you care?
Look, just go home
and keep your mouth shut.

1993
01:32:01,563 --> 01:32:03,963
Hey! You can't
talk to me like that.

1994
01:32:04,032 --> 01:32:05,727
I know things about you.

1995
01:32:05,834 --> 01:32:07,563
Well, if you know
what's good for you,

1996
01:32:07,635 --> 01:32:10,866
you'll go home,
and keep your mouth shut.

Has it helped you
in the polls?

Hey, folks,
Mr. Stacks is thrilled
for Annie and her family.

2000

We're gonna
miss you, Annie.

Yeah.

01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:49,510
We can finally get those
bubbles out of the apartment.

reuniting Annie
with her parents

2015
01:33:20,008 --> 01:33:22,704
has pushed him
into a dead heat
in the race for mayor.

2016
01:33:22,777 --> 01:33:25,541
He was once trailing
by as much as 30 points.

Hey, baby.
So, I haven't seen you
in here for a minute.

01:33:29,417 --> 01:33:30,509
To what do I
owe this pleasure?

2019

Take it easy.

2020
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:33,846
How you doing?

2021
01:33:33,922 --> 01:33:35,822
Not super awesome.

You want me to
make you a sandwich?

if I make you a key?

(SIGHS)

2025
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:43,757
You ever do
anything that you thought

2026
01:33:43,831 --> 01:33:46,322
was really a good idea
at the time,

2027
01:33:46,401 --> 01:33:48,528
but then after,
it's like
you're not so sure.

2028
01:33:48,603 --> 01:33:50,195
Yeah.
Putting up that key sign.

2029
01:33:50,271 --> 01:33:52,364
I don't know the first thing
about making keys.

2030
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:55,539
What's the matter, sweetie?
What did you do?

2031
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:57,908
'Cause, whatever it is,
you know I'm here to help.

Why are you so nice to me,
the way I treat you?

2033

Because under all that bitter,
there's a sweet lady
with a big heart.

2034
01:34:08,623 --> 01:34:10,591
She's just been gone
for a while. That's all.

01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,049
Hmm.

2036
01:34:13,928 --> 01:34:15,088
Yeah.

2037

Who am I,
and what have I become?

2038
01:34:27,675 --> 01:34:32,635
Do I stand for something
or for money?

2039

Who am I, and where's
my good girl gone?

a good heart once, you see

Who am I
now that my armor's gone?

2042
01:34:52,367 --> 01:34:57,304
You gave me
what I didn't know I needed

Who am I
now that my heart is won?

I didn't know
I needed anyone

But I've got today
But I've got today

stand for nothing,
you'll fall for it all

2399
01:52:58,285 --> 01:53:00,549
We got all we need,
got love and more

2400
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:04,920
You're never fully dressed
without a smile

2401
01:53:04,991 --> 01:53:07,755
And if you
stand for something,
you can have it all

2402
01:53:07,828 --> 01:53:10,092
'Cause if it's real,
you'll open every door

2403
01:53:10,163 --> 01:53:14,361
You're never fully dressed
without a smile

2404
01:53:19,639 --> 01:53:24,406
You're never fully dressed
without a smile

2405
01:53:24,478 --> 01:53:27,072
Oh

2406
01:53:29,015 --> 01:53:33,418
You're never fully dressed
without a smile

2407
01:53:33,487 --> 01:53:36,456
It's the hard-knock life
for us!

2408
01:53:36,523 --> 01:53:39,287
It's the hard-knock life
for us!

2409
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:42,351
'Steada treated

It's the hard-knock life

2412
01:53:57,344 --> 01:54:00,677
Don't it feel like
the wind is always howling?

2413
01:54:00,747 --> 01:54:03,511
Don't it seem like
there's never any light?

2414
01:54:03,583 --> 01:54:06,746
Once a day don't you wanna
throw the towel in?

2415
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:09,345
It's easier
than puttin' up a fight

2416
01:54:09,422 --> 01:54:12,357
No one's there
when your dreams at night
get creepy!

2417
01:54:12,425 --> 01:54:14,859
No one cares
if you grow
or if you shrink!

2418
01:54:15,996 --> 01:54:17,725
Empty belly life!

2419
01:54:18,965 --> 01:54:20,432
Rotten smelly life!

2420
01:54:21,801 --> 01:54:23,598
Full of sorrow life!

2421
01:54:24,738 --> 01:54:26,205
No tomorrow life!

2422
01:54:26,273 --> 01:54:29,140
Santa Claus we never see

2423
01:54:29,209 --> 01:54:32,076
Santa Claus
What's that? Who's he?

2424
01:54:32,145 --> 01:54:35,012
No one cares for you a bit

2425
01:54:35,081 --> 01:54:37,982
When you're a foster kid!

2426
01:54:38,051 --> 01:54:40,645
It's the hard-knock life!

2427

It's the hard-knock life

2428
01:54:48,361 --> 01:54:49,794
Yank the whiskers
from her chin

Moonquake, moonquake

2441
01:55:31,037 --> 01:55:32,971
I want to take a swim
in Lake Moon

Now I am awake, awake
